As my uterus departs my physical being,<br />&nbsp;I observe my mother gently have her mind depart her body.<br />She tells me this is the end is near<br />Though she cannot remember the name of the day<br />Or why she needs the patch I place<br />On her while pealing off yesterdays<br />The "memory loss patch"<br />And we laugh. <br /><br />Every. Single. Morning.<br /><br />And menopause arrives. <br /><br />I still see her wisdom shine through. <br />I trust and believe her<br />Most especially when I'm exhausted from<br />Giving care.<br /><br />We've made a deal<br />If she is having a freatting moment or is fixated<br />She is to ask me<br />So I can clear the air<br />Reassurance works<br />when remembered as an option<br /><br />Her therapist tells me to<br />cal myself her outside<br />hard-drive<br />which works when<br />remembered as an option<br /><br />I resort to thinking<br />As she did<br />when<br />I was the child.<br />Before a test I woke<br />in the middle of the night<br />Starlted out of sleep realzing<br />you can only do<br />the best you can do<br /><br />In Doctor's offices<br />We discuss the most<br />private of matters<br />Then we giggle. <br />We are professionals now<br />at paperwork and giggling. <br /><br />And I weep.<br />Tears fall<br />more gently than before<br />based on gratittude
