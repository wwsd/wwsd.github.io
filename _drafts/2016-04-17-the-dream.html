trust me, that's an incredibly boring title related to an actual dream. <br /><br />In my dream, my mother goes to do laundry in her familial home. &nbsp;She cries out and when I arrive, she's got blood oozing out of her mouth and her shoulder. <br /><br />I realize this, and lift her and call to m sisters whom are still children at this point and ask for my phone to call 911, but it's like there is a sock in my mouth - I cannot speak or scream or ask for help. <br /><br />The sister I'm closets to that ironically now lives in China, finally understands and calls for an ambulance. &nbsp;But she's not getting them to do anything so I take the phone from her - all the while with my mom in my arms. &nbsp;And I bitch 911 out and go outside in my nightgown with my mom in my arms. &nbsp;I end up in what seems to be my youngest sisters car. &nbsp;Kate is yelling at her as she has too many blankets in the back seat.<br /><br />I say - get away - get me the keys and I'm going. &nbsp;The hospital is just around the corner figure it out. &nbsp;They both go on banana seated bysicles, while I'm holding my bleeding mom and driving. <br /><br />i stop at the edge of a boulvard and ask directions to the hospital and this man turns into some sort of evil being - he's like "YOU ARE BLOCKING TRAFFIC" I'm screaming at him that I simply need directions to the hospital. &nbsp;His wife eventually comes out of the vehicle and explains that all I have to do is turn right and then go straight.<br /><br />I look at the man an say "you will end up in hell over this".<br /><br />I arrive at the imaginary hospital and I've still got my mom in my arms. &nbsp;I rush in and there is yes, indeed a bar and several nurses sitting at it. &nbsp;One actually get's up from her tequila and begins to take me with mom in my arms, now weighing less and less from blood loss, to her favorite doctor. &nbsp;At one point I stop her, as we are going up and down stairs on escalators - I'm seeing colorful children's rooms and I yell at her - I think my mother has just died in my very arms. &nbsp;The nurse stops in her tracks and begins to sob as I continue to yell at her that I am certain my mother has died. &nbsp;Then I yell at her for sobbing. <br /><br />And we move along. &nbsp;My mother now weighs nothing and her bones are crunching under my strong hands carriying her. &nbsp;She begins to take on the form of a dog - her dog - Willie a delightful, aged Yorkie. &nbsp;I keep screaming MOM MOM MOM - come back - I need you.<br /><br />And then.<br /><br />I wake up. <br /><br />I literally run downstairs to see if mom is OK - and she's fine. She's reading the paper on the couch and I am still shaken by my dream and ask if we can watch a PBS show we've been streaming - "Of course, Jenny, are you OK?" <br /><br />I'm not sure still that I am. &nbsp;Or ever will be.
