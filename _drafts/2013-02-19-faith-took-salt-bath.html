It seems incredibly sadand someone sacreligious to simply put my ipod Faith into a plastic garbage bag and toss it into the garbage bin.&nbsp; Faith was a gift from my incredible ex.&nbsp; Faith and I have traveled to many places, walked a million miles and cooked so many meals and gardned for hours on end together.&nbsp; We bathed together often as well, but her clip had fallen off about three months ago - something I knew which already signified the beginning of th end.&nbsp; It wasn't a surprise the night she drowned herself in the tub.&nbsp;
