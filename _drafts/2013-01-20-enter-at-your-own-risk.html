(insert tiny font legalize paragraph here)<br /><br />I'm beginning to come to terms with the fact that I'm a messenger; a kind of a conduit from the divine to others.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can often look at a person and see directly into the root of their pain.&nbsp; Before you go all calling me a spiritual dentist, let's talk about it.<br /><br />Do you want to know - do you REALLY want to know what is being shared with me to say to you?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's discuss things from my perspective a bit.....I've been working on my intutive abilities for a few years now.&nbsp; At first I studied it so that I could better communicate with the voiceless.&nbsp; IN the midst of that learning process I realized I was actually learning to communicate for the sake of healing for all living creatures - myself included.&nbsp;<br /><br />And finally, it has dawned on me, that I'm just here to communicate.&nbsp; To discuss.&nbsp; To start dialogues.&nbsp; To make us question.&nbsp; To help us wonder.&nbsp; To lend support.&nbsp; To love.<br /><br />Just as much as it is a challenge for you to understand what is happening with you - it's as diffuclut as it is for me to deliver a message you don't want to hear.<br /><br />And if you are already set on your path - you've already made your choice, please do not involve me.&nbsp; And please do not think you are a victim.&nbsp; Or not forewarned, because you were, you asked for it you got it.&nbsp; Toyata.<br /><br />I think it boils down to this - until we are completely open to remaining fluid about everything, why are we doing it? <br /><br />Avast ye matey's. &nbsp; <br /><br />
