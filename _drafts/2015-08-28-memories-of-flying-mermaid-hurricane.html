AS you move through your day today, it might be nice if you'd take a moment to thank a person you know who works with animals in a shelter environment. &nbsp; It's 10 years since Hurricane Katrina wrecked chaos across an entire region. <br /><br />This particular mermaid would prefer to be &nbsp;in or next to the ocean, or in the air soaring through the skies with a planeload of animals on their way to new families and safety. <br /><br />PICTURE<br /><br />I was involved with 923 directly affected hurricane Katrina animals, hundreds of volunteers, 9 airlifts, and thousands of other animals helped in the aftermath. <br /><br />The stories are endless; each day was a novel. <br /><br />People with philosophical differences showed up everywhere and made indelible, life-saving things happen.<br /><br />Many times I was asked why I wasn't helping the people. &nbsp;My response was simple - I AM. &nbsp;I'm helping the animals that are family members to so many. <br /><br />Many times I was asked "may we see an Katrina animal - we want to rescue one" . &nbsp;About three interviews with the press in, I saw a trend and began to see the huge picture. &nbsp;Every. Single. &nbsp;Homeless. Pet. &nbsp;Was. A victim of the storm, that left in my estimate upwards of 50,000 animals in distress. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
