<br />Often the spiritual work I do to heal myself, or "spirtual labor as Mary Anne Willimason calls it,&nbsp; it is suggested that looking back isn't the best plan. In many cases I believe that to be true.&nbsp; However, during the Holidays, memories play a large part in the magical energy that reminds me to enjoy every little bit. I also miss friends and family no longer able to physically sit at the same table for many reasons.&nbsp;<br /><br />The trick is,&nbsp; I allow myself to sit n the memories of all kinds for a bit. .&nbsp; I pay attention to focus on the positive of past experiences, but either way,&nbsp; homage is important an important tradition, for me..&nbsp; <br /><br />___________________________ <br /><br />Here are some of the In the spirit of gratitude, favorite Christmas memories are flooding in today<br /><br /><br />Things like the clock on the mantle downstairs ticking endlessly on Christmas Eve at My grandma and grandpa's home the very night night I am convinced to this day that I heard hooves on the roof; Galveston, on the beach and at the house when the electricity went out, 'forcing' us to grill things like shrimp and pots of melted butter;&nbsp; flying on Christmas day and watching at the airports the reunions of loved ones; the cats and dogs that shared Christmas with me when I lived on the properties of animal shelters;&nbsp; the time I came home to a real Christmas tree in my living room placed there by a caring friend - to my utter surprise; cousin's parties; decorating and cooking for the wedding of friends at the Lost Dog Deli; Christmas cookie creating (sometimes in august because you have lovely friends who understand you theme party concept)&nbsp; even;&nbsp; 'tree hunting' with Great Aunt Helen, Uncle Harold, Mike and us, sometimes in January because we'd not had time until then; handmaking mom's brilliant gifts o f the yar knowing fully that people would lov ewhat we were making if for no reason onther than the love we poured into it....the matching he family stockings; the food...oh the food....the friends, the family......How incredibly blessed I am and have been.&nbsp; What are some of your favorite things aroudn this time of year?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sitting and really thinking of those loved on-es unable to phscially meet us at the dinner table.&nbsp; Our opprtunities that by our clebrations we are allowed to slow down a bit, have a little time off work and actually live in the moment.<br /><br />But most of all - I think the Divine for the opportunity to share my graititude to with friends and family far and near.<br /><br />My Chrstams gift to you is to challenge yourself - maybe even all your family and friends - to sit down and make a list like this.&nbsp; and to share in any possible way - at the dinigrom talbe ro even on FB.&nbsp; Please take a break from the past to share some gratitude and memories.&nbsp; Talk abolut your family beliefs aroudn the Holiday of Christmas as well - document.&nbsp; Slow down to really feel it even if the gift you bought Joe cousin is not warpped yet - for it will be enterall true that our preces is the best presnt we can ever share. <br /><br />In deep, humble gratitude I wish you the most please of appreciate to share with you&nbsp; aren't wrapped <br /><br />a&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Ave Maria
