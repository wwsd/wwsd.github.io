Many years ago, I took a road trip with a dear friend and soemwhere in about the 11th hour driving having nearly overdosed ont he Eagles, I mentioned rather snarkily that my friend was complately tone deaf.<br /><br />To that friend.<br /><br />OMG, I still cringe thinking of it - if you could have seen the look on her face, you would too.&nbsp; What a horrific thing to say to someone I loved dearly, when all she was doind was living int hemoment with me on our way to a beach adventure (oh, I can't even figure out where to start telling THAT taile)<br /><br />Who cares?&nbsp; The woman is Martha Stewart mixed with Ghandi, a side of Buddah andinsert your own favorte commdiane here.&nbsp; A mother beyond compaer to both human and canine species, a devoted wife and above all - a life long cheerleader to yours truly.<br /><br />I still have PTSD over that whole thing.<br /><br />I'm sorry,and you know who you are.&nbsp; SO sorry.<br /><br />Many moons ago, I just remembered, someone said to me "you areawful at taking photographs".&nbsp; (friend above is talanted at THAT too,I might add) I remember thinking, Oh,OH,wow - I mustn't then ever make the world look at my photos again.&nbsp; I don't remember who it was, or the context or if we were h ungy andgry tire dor lonely - but I do remember it stuck. <br /><br />So just a oment ago I was editing a picture I took not so long ago as in last week&nbsp; and I went to crop it as i almost always must crop because i've got have a toe or someones eybrows or I forgot to zoom or or or - and I looked at this photo and realized - it was perfect.&nbsp; Absolutely perfect.&nbsp; I don't expect to win the pulizer of photogaphy anytime soon, but I do think it's one of the best pictures I've ever taken.<br /><br />Prone to over thinking like others are to breathing, I flashed back to tone deaf PTSD/you can't take a picture moment.
