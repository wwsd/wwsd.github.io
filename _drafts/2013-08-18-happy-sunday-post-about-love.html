Ok, so this might be a wee bit of a mushy post.&nbsp; Feel free to run for the hills now, if that is not what you are in the mood for today.&nbsp; (ends disclamer here)<br /><br />All my life Sunday has been a sacred, recharging, special day for me.&nbsp; Trust me, it wasn't because I went to church, there wasn't ever an repentence.&nbsp; What there was is this space of serenity, love and happy recharge unlike any other day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last weekend a dear pal was here and went to the store - to get makings for pot roast and gravy and pototatoes.&nbsp;<br /><br />He pulled into the drive with this I just swalled the canary look and what to my wondering eyes shoudl appear but sunflowers and Irish butter (complete, I might add) with a yellow ribbon AND a cheesecake that someone had graciously decorated with the words "Happy Sunday".<br /><br />The tales of his advntures at the grocery store that particular trip are far too numberous to list here.&nbsp; Suffice to say by the time he left - he'd made friends with half the staff and several other fellow consumers.<br /><br />His only regret was that I wasn't there to see all that chaotic joy that he created.&nbsp; Because, as my pal, he knows there is no finer gift to me that observering and or creating joy.&nbsp; (it even tops crochet and that is VERY high on my joy meter scale)<br /><br />We laughed for hours over the entire experience - I might add, his gravy was AMAZING on top of the mashed potatoes and for a girl who loves broccoli as much as she loves to breath, I never even got there. <br /><br />Part of what we laughed (joyfully, fyi) about was the fact that it is indeed possible to share joy and create ripple effects.&nbsp; The checkout person looked at the cake and said "I want a happy Sunday cake" and Tall,(read: coudl have just retired from the NFL) well built, plthe man soudns like super manly man that put the yellow bows on the Irish butter was all in too. <br /><br />I mean how many times do youever in your life wrap irish butter with a curly ribbon anyway&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I think what this boils down ti, is that we need to start a Happy sundy revolution.&nbsp; There is a Sunday each week - and if even 4 or 5 of us startted to fun about in full on joy mode - well, I think there would be a lot more Happy Sunday cakes, and there might be a bit of a run on curly ribbin as well. <br /><br />So, who is in? <br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjh_kK62lY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjh_kK62lY</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
