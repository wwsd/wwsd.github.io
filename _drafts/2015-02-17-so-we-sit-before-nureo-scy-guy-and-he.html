So we sit before a nureo scy guy and he does this 40 quesiont thing ad we laugh. &nbsp;He askes her eveyrthing firest then he askes me, the care giver. and I know shit has hit the fan. \\He then takes her away for her "tests" which she is freaked out about failing and I attempt to lend her comfort - remind her I'll be back to get her as soon as tis is over.<br /><br />The night before she is like a child. &nbsp;She can't find the way to manage this circumstance and I can't find the way to comfort her. &nbsp;It's painful for both of us. <br /><br /><br /><br />loss of comfort zonesupport network - their feeling of abadonment<br />tough discussions - end of life choices<br /><br />
