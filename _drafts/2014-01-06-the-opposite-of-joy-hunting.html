I will now proceed to write a blog post that is me complaing about complaing.Good thing irony is one of mypreferred forms of humor.<br /><br /><br />So, I work for a law office, long distance, doing bookkeeping.&nbsp; When I lived closer, I did a great deal of client care - and goodness, it was rewarding.&nbsp; (I know, I KNOW - that doesn't sound like complaining)<br /><br /><br />Personally, I see two different reasons that complaining is not the best plan.<br /><br />1) i'ts yucky energy going back out into the univers that will perpetuate - I think they call that karma<br />2) It might be that you are digging a leagla hole. <br /><br />&nbsp; So, I work for a law firm, long distance, doing bookkeeping.&nbsp; When I  lived closer, I did a great deal of client care - and goodness, it was  rewarding.&nbsp; (I know, I KNOW - that doesn't sound like complaining)<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges for me when doing client care, was to explain to people how absolutely careful they need to be when posting anything online on any social media network about their situation. <br /><br />Now, I will admit, I have a rough time with people complaining in general - most especially when they aren't doing anything to change the situation.<br /><br />We've become such a reactive society.<br /><br />And hear&nbsp; me when I say there are some things that absolutely need prublic awareness. <br /><br />And I was born in 1969 so just under the wire as a flower child, who believes in standing up for what - anything - actually - we belive in that feels wrong.&nbsp;<br /><br />But here's the deal - (keeping in mind I"ve not attende that pesky little thing called law school) the more you complain or vent or spew about your issues that may require legal assistance, the bigger you dig your own hole.&nbsp;<br /><br />For instance - i fyou are leaving a domestic partnership because your spouse drinks too much&nbsp; and that has been a gib struttle in your rleationship - Well, may I suggest don't have every picture of YOU up on your wall since the break up holding obvious alchol containers - say like BEeR BOTTLES. <br /><br />If you are trying to gain/regain/adopt - I think i'ts a good idea to not post things about how spanking made you more respectful. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong - you can absolutely feel like all of what you post is so true - and&nbsp; it is.&nbsp; It's your truth.&nbsp;<br /><br />It' s far too easy to damange the 'right choice' wiht a mispoken word on a soclic media site.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />REadt?&nbsp; IT DOES NOT EVER GO AWAY. <br /><br />One of my most interesting things was a mom that had the child taken away from her.&nbsp; She wanted the child and all she did was complasin about it.&nbsp; Until she left the hcild behind <br />So complaining not only has negative energy rammications - but the legal ones - oh wow.&nbsp; A friend onf mine wrote a book called "reputation management - it's in the for cummies line and we laughed one day - really what it boils down to, is to not say anything onine OR off that ......<br /><br /><br />
