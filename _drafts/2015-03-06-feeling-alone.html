My mom has been diagnosed by neuro-psych testing that tells us she has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. &nbsp;This has been no big surprise, but it's not any less taxing knowing what the specialists think it is.<br /><br />No matter the diagnosis, there is a mountain of mixed dementia occurring and it's, well, to say the least, not easy. &nbsp;For some of us it's utterly uneasy. &nbsp; I often work to step into her shoes and even go so far as to have dreams of feeling like she does currently. <br /><br />None of this means I'm a good caregiver. &nbsp;I am much more of an observer having worked in animal care for more years than I care to admit, I've learned to observe, so it's easy for me to hand over what she needs when I sense she needs it. &nbsp;At least she can verbalize, whereas a cat can only meep or meow. <br /><br />The morning, many months ago when we had company - as in her grandson and a pal, visiting from China - she didn't even know who I was. &nbsp;Needless to say that was the day I said it was time to do further investigation.<br /><br />Here's what we know for certain:<br />&nbsp;- she cannot drive<br />&nbsp;- she is consistently confused as to which day it is, where she is, who people are and often, she forgets she's even hungry. She doesn't know what meds to take when and many of them that she is/was on, were not helping her get any better. <br />&nbsp;- she loves her family<br />&nbsp;- she's grateful for the care any and all give her<br /><br />BUT, she's particular (gee, wonder where I got that from?) about the energy around her. &nbsp;Her definition vs. anyone's is different. &nbsp;As it should be....this is still her life and still her space. <br /><br />We thought we had someone else to help, an sort of adopted family member. &nbsp;Young, yet wise beyond her word. &nbsp;Today, mom tells me she simply doesn't like her. <br /><br />Now, my question is, will she remember that? <br /><br />And I feel more alone than I ever have in my entire life. &nbsp;24/7 care is required here. &nbsp;Mom's left the stove on twice now in the night. &nbsp;She wanders - I've found her out front, out back both in the middle of the night and the lastest wandering was her leaving the hotel room I was in with her and roaming the hotel. &nbsp;I heard nothing, I was so tired. <br /><br />What kind of caregiving is that? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
