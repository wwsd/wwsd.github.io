&nbsp;I can understand why Hemingway chain smoked and drank like a fish these days.<br /><br />I"m doing a lot of heavy duty, healing, release writing here lately.&nbsp; <br /><br />You know the kind - the words that are hidden the most deeeply within you that are also helping you die the less you let them out.&nbsp; The kind you wonder if your family may disown you for.&nbsp; The kind of words that make even you stop mid-porchswing and think - what?&nbsp; That just took the breath out of me.<br /><br />This kind of writing requires deep solitude for me.&nbsp; I can't worry if I'm late for dinner or if I'm affecting someone with my returning thoughts wishing to be written words.&nbsp; I can't take a break to go to lunch with a gal pal or hit the mall.&nbsp; My entire being must be focused on the words that need to get out of me. <br /><br />Thsse words not only heal me, but carry with them the hope that others might be healed as well; or in the very least find some light even within the darkest depths. <br /><br />IT's a sacred obligation to share - almost a sacred obsession.&nbsp; It's just this side of being a sacred addiction. &nbsp; <br /><br />I'm not going all Sylvia Plath on anyone here - I'm doing what I am led to do - get it out and see what sort of sense it makes and then share it. &nbsp; I know too, that I'm searching for some sort of balance in my everyday life - so it may appear disconserting to those around in my immediate space.&nbsp; It may even look like I don't give a shit about 'normal', and frankly, I may not give a shit about it.<br /><br />This writing does NOT give me an escape route - this is not an situation that allows me to hide from anything.&nbsp; In fact, it is the opposite.&nbsp; I'm facing head on things that have mired me down and kept me stuck for 43 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
