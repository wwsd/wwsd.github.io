Not many moons ago, I reached the ripe age of 45.&nbsp; It was one of the more lovely Birthday's of my life as I actually got to spend it with my mother, aunt and two near and dearfriends.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks as mid life as a crisis really needs to likely see a therapist - I've never found a space so profound, comfortable, loving and exciting.&nbsp; I actually believe in myself now for the first time in my life. <br /><br />My belief system of gratitude has shown me paths to places unheard of in the magical universe of healing. <br /><br />Flash back to me at 19 and see me and my sisters findoing oursleves in a west texas town filled with angst, anger, fruatration and uprootedtedness the likes of which I'd never ever heard could happen in all the millions of books I've read.&nbsp; My mom was in a new relationship having left my sperm donor - and I was in a space of well - 19 year old anger.&nbsp; It was not a pretty mix.&nbsp; enerfies in home were fluid/grieving/angry - you name it. <br /><br />Flash forward to 45.&nbsp; and find these people - these family either blood or found and realize you are the most fortunate woman on earth. <br /><br />Gift after gift - many silly - others profound - all just right.&nbsp; And get to the bottom of a brown paper bag and discover the irony of a joke I'd said a few days ago - all Texax women must be properply accesoriezed.&nbsp; And find a string of perals.&nbsp; Learn they are real and not only that but that in between each pearl is a purple beat. <br /><br />as I put them on full on tears are flying down my cheaks at a rate of speak I'm sure a State Trouper could arrest me fore and then look up at the gift giver. <br /><br />I dare you to not find the joy in this circumstance. <br /><br />You see, I grew up in a home that included old movies as a regular part of my idet.&nbsp; I had always in my heart thoughtt tht pears were to be given to girls at 16 by their father.&nbsp; I have always loved pears - they are inctricate creations of opysters that allow me to remember nothing is ever perfect - but there is beuaty in imperfection. <br /><br />As I put them around my nek we all laughed (as I needed more kleenex because I was sobbing) that at 45 years old, I found my father/brother/firend and I was finally ready to feel worthy of perals. <br /><br />the timing could not have been more perfect at all. <br /><br />Nor, could I have handled feeling that cherished before that ver moment.<br /><br />so thank you.&nbsp; Kidn sir you've szhown me that I'm more than I ever hoped to be and how easy it is to push every single limit of graititude. <br /><br />It's not really about the perals - though they do rather lend me a feeling of putting on a super power cape - the love and understanding behind them is more than extraodinary.&nbsp; This gift of imperfection was perfection.&nbsp; I loe you.<br />u&nbsp; &nbsp;
