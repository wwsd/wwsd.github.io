Oh how exhausted i am from people suggesting to me how I should act and feel and behave.<br /><br />One of the larger potholes I've tripped over is regarding my sleep patterns.&nbsp; so, here's the deal, everyone - they are MY sleep patterns.&nbsp; You getting up at 5 am does not make you a better person that me and in fact that's on eof my favrotie times to go to sleep!&nbsp; Thanks thpough!<br /><br />Coming to the table for dinner is another place that makes me slightly sad abnd more than a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; Keep in mind that due to my sleep pattern, 5 to 9 PM is my primse time of day - it's when I create the best and th emost.&nbsp; So when you need me to sit with you for a meal, and I donb't like that idea, that's why.&nbsp; It is NOTHING personal.<br /><br />Leaving the house - Oh this one is one of my very favorites.&nbsp; So, becasue YOU like to leave the house and interact with others means I should too, right?&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER.&nbsp; It doesn't mean I'm a recluse or that I"m depressed becasue I dont' feel like interacting socially with a bunch of putz's in a bar.&nbsp; Just sayin'.&nbsp; Been there, done that. <br /><br />DRIVING - oh yes, no. <br /><br />Working - Oh - seriously =- it's not about suffering people - and if you arn'et working you dream career - be grateful for that too - it's pays the bills and you don't have to take it home with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Appearcne -<br /><br />So I work from home.&nbsp; While I don't have a commute first thing int he morngi - ti offten means I 've got to jumpt into work as soon as I wake up.&nbsp; Which means there are somedays where I don't get dressed or have time for a shower.&nbsp; YES it rocks to be in my pj's at my 'office".&nbsp; But more often than not, it's not a matter of choice, so quit bitching about it, please.&nbsp; I"m not any less worthy of love because I'm wearing leopard spots.&nbsp; And I'm CERTAINALY not as lazy as you assume.&nbsp;<br /><br />-fun - yep it IS true - an dnot just a rumor you've eard that to each their own is super cool!&nbsp; I like wine.&nbsp; A lot of it.&nbsp; That is one of my fun zones.&nbsp; In case it's not one ofyours, doesn't mean ou have a free pass to judge me....<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
