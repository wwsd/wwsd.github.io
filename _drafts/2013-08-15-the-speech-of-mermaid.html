Many moons ago I watched "The King's Speech" and was found speechless throughout at the position we "hirerach" stress into people of a ceratin assumed privelage.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was during that same time I saw "The Help" and found myself enraged, thrilled and enlightened by the very same film so many times I thougt I would never see another that struck me on so many layers, so profoundly.<br /><br />It occurs to me now, that they are both related to something that used to be referred to as "The human condition".&nbsp; Meaning - it was innate, unchangeable in the eyes of the exisiting societies - one being a stutter, the other a skin color.<br /><br />It also occurs to me now, both in scientific and emotional intellgence, we have made turns into a direction of wellness as socieities -<br /><br />So last week, I had what my lawyer boss and I called "work camp" meaning we did a whole lot of accounging very related only to numbers and billing.&nbsp; /by the end of the week I nearly found myself blind.<br /><br />A) I was exhausted - as I'm not used to working more than a few hours a day at numbers (as a right-brained person, it's nearly inhumane to do otherwise)<br />B) I'm not 12 anymore - I'v ealways needed glasses to see properly and so it is very possible I'm losing some sight as I've turned into my 44 th year<br />c) I foudn myself thinking of the King and of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and realizesed there wan nothing I could not overcome &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
