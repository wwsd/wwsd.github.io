My sister, Anna&nbsp; and I had a feeling it was going to be THAT kind of a day when we both met in the kitchen at 3 this morning.&nbsp; I was still up, she was up again and had bathed one of the dogs.&nbsp; I think I may have overdosed a wee bit on sweet tea, something my body is not grateful for at this stage.&nbsp; We laughed for a bit - should we play cards?&nbsp; We really need to buy a Scrabble board.&nbsp; This wild sleep rhythm is crazy.<br /><br />So a few hours later we were having coffee trying to plan the day.&nbsp; Turns out lawnmower/tractor maintenance was rather high on the list, so the lawn could get mowed.&nbsp; I am here to tell you Anna needs to walk around with a sign around her neck - or maybe a sandwich board advertising a disclaimer that she is not responsible for the harm caused to any object, living or innanitmate being ruined by spewing beverages.&nbsp; She is killer funny.&nbsp; We had the quote of the day before 7:38 A.M.&nbsp; Her humor is so commonplace, however, that I couldn't tell you what that quote was.<br /><br />So off Anna went to get some belts and I crocheted to ground myself because it was high time I learned a bit about lawnmower repair and she had agreed to teach me.&nbsp; It was a big day.<br /><br />Let me set the scene a bit for you - Anna is a stunningly beautiful, true southern woman.&nbsp; She practially puts on earrings and lipstick before she pees in the morning.&nbsp; You know, just in case.&nbsp;
