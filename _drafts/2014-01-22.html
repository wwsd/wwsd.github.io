&nbsp;I wanted to talk to you about this poster - it's such a touchy subject - I thought maybe we could chat about it offline a bit - I have a hard time with this one.&nbsp; I've worked with dozens of breed rescue organizations that are indeed breeders - responsible ones, and who have taken in some dogs that have very breed specific issues, worked with them and rehomed them.&nbsp; And the American Kennel Club helped me help THOUSANDS of animals after many devastating hurricanes.&nbsp; I think we (as in the animal care world 'we") need to be careful to not generalize like this and sure, there are so many irresponsible breeders out there - but certainly not all of them.&nbsp; I'd hate to see us lose the support that IS there.<br /><br />It's a tough conversation to have - but I can tell you in the past week that two rescue organizations - one that I worked with in the past and the other I'm unsure of the name - that have had to close down for hoarding situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
