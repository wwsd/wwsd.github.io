Recently I and a long time friend&nbsp; made a trek to our home state to connect with friends and family for various reasons.&nbsp; It came together quickly with every kind of serendipity imaginable, and as I am learning now, those glitches that did exist felt like "OK, thanks, I'll go ahead and take care of that now, appreciate the message".<br /><br />This friend and I are well practiced in the art of road trips, thankfully as the drive is 12 hours mapquest time - so be thinking 13.5 including breaks&nbsp; from the deep south to the northern north.&nbsp; <br /><br />About midway though this particular trip we mentioned to each other at nearly the same moment just exactly how uncomfortable the seats in the vehicle actually were; CLEARLY a sign it's time for a 'rest your rear end spot' and/or get out of the car for a bit.<br /><br />Ever proof of "ask and ye shall receive",&nbsp; we saw two restaurants at the next exit - one of which had been closed for oh, I don't know, 20 years (but that you could not tell until you were OFF The highway) and the other was&nbsp; a sparklying new breakfast anytime chain - ya can't go wrong with breakfast right?&nbsp; Well hang on to your hats, gentle readers.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />As we enter the restaurant It's eerily quiet (well for a second, until you realize Megadeath is the piped in muszac of choice) - as in not a customer to be spotted.&nbsp; but I kid you not when I tell you there were no less than 10 polyester clad service staff almost eager to seat us.&nbsp; Having been in the restaurant business for many moons, I realized this might be a training thing - so I sat down while my friend went ot the resterroom.&nbsp; Meanwhile I noticed there was no shortage of of kitchen help either - I casn see three and hear another two.<br /><br />I start to ponder food choices- starving for anything other than early American fried drive through or almonds and a what has turned into a 12 day old banana in 6 hours - I'm ready.&nbsp; When my friend approaches the table I keenly observe that she is wide eyed.&nbsp; Not one to jump to comclusions anymore as to what that might mean, I ask her.<br /><br />and I quote"THERE ARE MORE OF THEM INSIDE THE BATHROOM". <br /><br />So, we did our best to settle into this very stepford wive/delivernce mode, because, after all we were hungy and their seats were oh so much more more comfortable than those in the vehicle.<br /><br />I'd ben thinking I'd go with a salad or anything pretty much with only veggies and protien until my friend ordered.&nbsp; It wasn't that it was a complicated order from her, it was that I saw the rather glazed over dazed look in the sesrver's eyes and realized - Oh, simple, simple is best. <br /><br />Meanwhile one person brings out the coffee.&nbsp; another the creamer.&nbsp; another my tea.&nbsp; another my lemon.&nbsp; A totally different server I'd not seen anywhere (perhaps she'd been in the restroom while I wasn't) brought us water. <br /><br />I hear with my ever so clever ears the server attempt to explain to the cooks what the order means.&nbsp; I'm beginning to smell disaster in a well toasted, grilled cheese kind of&nbsp; manner, so I mention to my travling companions it might not go as well as she'd hoped - hating to be the one to put that out in the universe, but hoping that her expectation level would decrease though there are now what appears to be 32,004 staff members in the house all of whom are now in the kitchen of said national chain diner..<br /><br /><br />I ordeed some quiesadillas - with extra pico de gallo.(remember, major vegetable craving happening here)We aren't pickly women, for the recored - we like what we like and aren't afriad to ask for it anymore - huge middle age perk, fyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;Alas!&nbsp; Here comes our&nbsp; food - it is OK enough to eat.&nbsp; Meanwhile I discover&nbsp; my pico de gallo, has approximately 14,007 halenpo peppers with one chopped up slice of tomato (a strange almost orange color I might add) and half an onion.&nbsp; It sure as hell woke my ass<br /><br /><br />
