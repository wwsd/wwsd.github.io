My father died almost a year to the day that one of my dear friends also lost his dad. &nbsp;My situation was filled with mixed emotions of relief, sadness and even joy. <br /><br />My friend's is a different story - as are all of ours. <br /><br />I was prepared to have an odd day at the one year anniversary of my father's death, but I was instead astounded by the mere fact that acknowleding the day was enough. <br /><br />The death of my friend's father affected me (is still) more deeply than the death of my own father and that is a bit of an odd space, but one also that begs to be acknowledged. &nbsp;My spirit wishes for me to thank God for the differences in these men and to stop for a moment to think about how fortunate we all are to be on this earth, sometimes even at the same time. <br /><br />I was finished with my dad. &nbsp;I had learned all I needed, I had forgiven him, I had let it go. &nbsp;And trust me, there was a lot to let go. <br /><br />I wasn't finished with my friend's father. &nbsp;He was a shaman and a teacher and a doctor and a friend. &nbsp;I didn't have nearly enough time to thank him, nor to learn from him. &nbsp;I may not have been a lifetime friend of his, but he impacted me in the times we did have in manners I always had dreamed of having a father impact me. &nbsp;His unusual sense of humor. &nbsp;His wisdom. &nbsp;His ability to heal by simply holding my hand. &nbsp;I'm one of thousands that feel this way about this man, and I realize that. &nbsp;It's perhaps what makes it so precious, this time I had with him.<br /><br />The first night I re-met him after 11 years, we laughed so heartily, I thought for certain I might just laugh myself to death. &nbsp;Good thing there was a doctor in the house. &nbsp;I'd forgotten to bring a bathing suit to his pool, so he literally went inside, changed his clothing and handed me his swim trunks and t-shirt and instructed me to get in the pool immediately. &nbsp;After finding a private place to change, I followed those instructions and proceeded to meet whom I now cal the mini-mermaids. &nbsp;I floated, I swam. &nbsp;I laughed, I giggled and I played as thought I was one of the 5 or 6 year olds in the pool and I felt so much better, I could breathe again.<br /><br />When I got out, he was there with a towel and sat me down. &nbsp;yikes. &nbsp;How we came to this part of the conversation I will never know - but I will also never forget. &nbsp;"Have you ever heard a Giraffe laugh?" &nbsp;he asked. &nbsp;Could have been a reference to my long neck, could have been some obscure option on anything - but my answer was no. &nbsp;I had not even ever met a giraffe, so I may have missed that. <br /><br />The very day he passed, smoeone donated a giraffe collection to the resale shop my aunt works for. &nbsp;And she brought home the funniest stuffed giraaffee I'd ever happened upon as a gift for me. <br /><br />I do believe that now, I have heard a giraffe laugh. &nbsp;Thanks for being the father I needed, exactly when I needed it, kind sir. &nbsp;I shall never forget you giving the clothes off your back and reminding me that all things have great joy.
