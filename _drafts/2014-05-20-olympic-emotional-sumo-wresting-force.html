And now, a word from our sponors:<br /><br />I work part time for a Lawyer who lives in Ohio doing billing and other bookkeeping things and it has lately turned itno this whole lovely thing - where even on days when i'm not sure I have emotional capcity to work (got some major breathgouths ogn on around here in Jennifer-land) I suddenly find hours have passed and not only do I have a great feeling of accomplishment - in a rather amusing way for this completley right brauin girl I feel like I've been on a mini vacation.&nbsp; I'm in total sit stay mode and don't even have to talk mysel fout ouf of overthinking.&nbsp; So, here's to acounting as a productive sit stay tool.c <br />my right branin can go on and brainsrm for ahouse all in her little introvert way with no harm done.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />evil tiwns<br /><br />I have this lovely, crazy, creative group of friends that I run with that we call The sisterhood of the Cork.&nbsp; Way back when we started to get into this healing zone many of us found ourselfes at a loss for what to do with our evil twins.&nbsp; We knew the work we were doing was important and all about growth, but we forgot how much and tha twe were getting somewhere when we felt a bit of a split personality thing going on.&nbsp; So, we decided to name our evil twins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />This theraputic moment brought o me by<br />and crhocet - wihich I fondly refer to as productive figdeting is also a healing space for me. Because I design a lot of my own patterns, I'll often discover I'm bak in left bran lan before I know what even happened.&nbsp; AND by having several different projects going at once, I can pick something colorful for the days that feel a little gloomy out emotionally - and upon occasion a lovely simple, repetavie pattern nearly catipulsts me into a zen space.<br /><br />I think we all need breaks from our emotional sumowrestling, especially when we are on the edge of working out something that will shift our entire perspectives on life....
