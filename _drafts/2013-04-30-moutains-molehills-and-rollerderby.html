For the bulk of my life, I have been massivly successful at making drama happen, or to re-incite it. <br /><br />I have yet to have found a career in the mountain/molehill zone, erhaps I might consider screenplay writing <br />I enjoyed creating drama as much as some enjoy crack cocaine.&nbsp; It was my mission&nbsp; my purpose - becaue what I knew how bes to do was to feel ashamed.&nbsp; (I'm still really great at that, fyi, but awaare of it now - Hi, my name is Jennifer)<br /><br />
