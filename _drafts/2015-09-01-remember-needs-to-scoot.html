I've noiced how much I use the word "remember", here lately. <br /><br />Our population is aging<br />Drs are meant to heal and Alz is a scary place for the humans inside the docotrs.<br /><br />What we've forgotten is that poepl with ALZ need their own support. <br /><br />Pre-grief = watching someone brilliant lose what day. <br /><br />Say what you want to say while you can<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
