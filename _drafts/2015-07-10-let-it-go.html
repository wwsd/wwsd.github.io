Yep, it's an all caps, sounds like, may feel like I'm yelling. &nbsp;Because I am. Over mountains, into caynons, through clouds, over praries and into bodies of water. <br /><br />These past several days has been mindblowing on the scale of losses and gains. &nbsp;A human I dearly love have passed, the anniversary of a death of a family member, watching the United States Supreme Court make some amazing choices, and finally, it came down to sorting through my mom's closet to make more room for sorting. &nbsp;Isn't that ironic.<br /><br />At a mere 46 years old I own some stuff. (stuff can be mental or physical in my life these days) &nbsp;Those of you that know me, realize it's mostly books, yarn and some clothing I adore; in pretty much that order. <br /><br />Nope, I'm not hiking the Scotland Highlands with my sister (as invited) because my life has taken a serious left curve. &nbsp;I'm exhausted and the very thought of hicking 15 miles a day makes me have the southern vapors (not to be confused with the northern vaporsO <br /><br />I do tire more easily these days. &nbsp;I find myself in the midst of unheard of situations. <br /><br />My favorite of late is my mother now has an open case in the Adult Care system of the state of texas. &nbsp;I'm the alleged abusor. &nbsp;I could go on about this for hours and the reasons are well, simply put absolutly insane. The most important one to me is that I overdrug my mother. <br /><br />What? &nbsp;I said to kind, doing her job investigator as I handed her a list of peple she could call to check that out. <br /><br />My second favorite was that I lock my mom in her room while I party. &nbsp;Couple of thoughts there - 1) I can't lock her doors from the outside. &nbsp;2) My mom has always been the life of any party and 3) WHAT? <br /><br /><br />
