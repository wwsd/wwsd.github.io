So, for years, I've had an on and off relationship with my mother. &nbsp;These have been both delightful and painful times. &nbsp;Of late, with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and as her primary caregiver, I've realized how much she means to me.<br /><br />I intend to use this space to explain and explore some of how I feel, some of how she does and how we cope with all of it. &nbsp;I have full permission, in the hopes that others may learn, relate and feel better in their own experiences. <br /><br />____________________________________<br /><br />Doctor's visit 101<br /><br />My nephew and his friend were visiting us from China the morning that my very own mother did not recognize me. &nbsp;It was terrifying on layers I'm unable to put into words as of yet. &nbsp;As mentioned above, we'd not spent a great deal of time together in over 12 years and I missed her.<br /><br />The morning she didn't know who I was, taught me LOUD AND CLEAR that I had no idea what actual "missing" was. <br /><br />I insisted that we do some further exploration into what may be happening, and while that was a good plan, it also meant that we would learn the eventual truth. &nbsp;And I wondered, often, whether or not it was worth the trek to specialists and hospitals 5 hours from her comfort zone - from home, to uncover what was truly happening. <br /><br />We knew what was happening, but no many of us, in the family were willing to deal with any of it; denial became a river we'd had loved to canoe down despite warnings. <br /><br />Mind you, &nbsp;my timing was spot on. <br /><br /><br />so I took her to a couple of local docs she'd been using for years and then I realized, it was time to break out the big guns. &nbsp;So my aunt, a pal and Mom drove to Scott and white in Temple, Texas. &nbsp;I remember as they drove off feeling as though I should go, but someone had to take care of the dog. <br /><br />On the way home, after not much news on the doctor front,a tire blew out on a bridge with not much of a side place to pull off upon and my mom's pal saved their lives. <br /><br />Those were the good old days.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
