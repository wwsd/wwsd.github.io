Jodie Foster let it all out recently.&nbsp; She told the whole universe that she is single.&nbsp; Oh, and that she loves her mom.<br /><br />I'll be honest and say I'm single too. &nbsp; I'll even go so far as to admit that I love my mom - and she loves me. <br /><br />This is a bigger conversation that just "let gay people marry".You know that as much as I do - this is a civil rights discussion.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our nation has had this conversation time and time again.&nbsp; Remember that era where women had to fight to vote?&nbsp; Or that Civil War (by the way, I've been meaning to ask - what is civil about war?) That whole time when we let anyone be able to urinate in any restroom or sit anywhere on a bus.<br /><br />OH, that reminds me, I've got a couple of questions for you before you even think you can marry.&nbsp; 1) so, do you do it doggie style?&nbsp; Because, we can't have people that love each other doing that kind of sexual act.&nbsp; It would scar our nation.&nbsp; oh and 2) if you give your hubby a&nbsp; blow job, do you swallow?&nbsp; As anation we frown on any kind of potential sperm loss.&nbsp; 3) do you have sexual fantasies?&nbsp; Because well, that' just plainly inappropriate because I said so, that's why. <br /><br />I don't think that we have any idea how far and deep our words&nbsp; go.<br /><br />A friend told me that someone had been over the top rude to her today.&nbsp; I shared a story of a customer I'd had years ago that went 'postal rude' on me until I simply asked him why he felt the need to be so rude to me.&nbsp; You could have heard a pin drop.&nbsp; He didn't have any bit of a clue that he was being rude.&nbsp; So, I'm going to pretend that you haven't a clue that you are being rude to me by telling me I can't marry a woman, OK?&nbsp; Do you see now that you are being rude?&nbsp; <br /><br />this battle we are having these days feels to me as though society is turning it's back on love.&nbsp; Think about it.<br /><br />Did I miss something here?&nbsp; I thought this nation was one of opportunity.&nbsp; Of hope.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand fear of change.&nbsp; It's the only thing I can come up with that actually makes a tinge of sense around this fight against love.<br /><br />I"m fairly certain that even Tomas Jefferson would be ashamed of this great nation's behavior about love.<br /><br />And if it's NOT OK for a woman to marry a woman - why is it OK for a man to have more than one wife?&nbsp; I can't find a difference other than testoserone.&nbsp; <br /><br />What does it matter to anyone?&nbsp; It does indeed matter.&nbsp; It matters that we can all live in any sort of relationship we want to.<br /><br /><br />Knock knock.&nbsp; Who's there?&nbsp; Hitler.&nbsp; Hitler who?<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />Call me silly, but I'm fairly certain the bible is a love story, so I've already tired of that argument, too. <br /><br />what is offensive about love?&nbsp; really - give it your best shot.&nbsp; Are you afraid?&nbsp; Of what?&nbsp; Do you actually think that by me being a bi sexual that children that spend any time with me might be tainted by my belief system - you know the one that is all about love?&nbsp; <br /><br />It's so beyond my comprehension I am starting to get angry.&nbsp; Are you pissed that we aren't discussing YOUR sex life?&nbsp; Is that it?&nbsp; Are you jealous you aren't labled based on your bedroom habits? <br /><br />Honestly?&nbsp; Did ya forget about that crazy battle called the Civil War?&nbsp; Or - that MLK and other (gasp) people of color that shaped our nations ethics? <br /><br />Has anyone asked you what it is that bothers you about a couple in love getting married. &nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone asked you<br /><br /><br />Where did our love go? <br /><br />I don't want to have to go all Rosa Parks and find a bus to run y'all over with, but really. It's time to stop all this shit and lean into the most important thing on earth - love.
