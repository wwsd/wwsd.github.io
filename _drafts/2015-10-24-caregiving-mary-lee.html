Mary Lee is my mother. &nbsp;She's been officially diagnosed with "mixed dementia". &nbsp;Though it depends on which of her brilliant doctors you speak to....in the opinion of more than one, she has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. &nbsp;I've been her caregiver for over a year and a half now and the whole conversation about "what's happening here" occurred when she forgot my name one morning. <br /><br />As time as gone by, I've learned this is a prime example of project management. <br /><br />First, we needed to get her medication schedule under control. &nbsp;She was taking her own and would often double take (even with those handy dandy little daily pill packs - hard to use when you can't remember what day it is) or forget to take. &nbsp;This was causing a lot of additional issues. &nbsp;Not to mention she was on some medications she'd been on for years that she no longer needed and were doing things like cause low sodium and falls and even high blood sugar. &nbsp;Diet was the next fix and we managed to eradicate type two diabetes. &nbsp;Needless to say the day that happened, there were many tears of joy and snoopy dances had. <br /><br />The falls were scary for all of us. &nbsp;While in actuality, Mary Lee's blood pressure is fine.
