I care  about punctuation as much as a sociopath cares about murder.&nbsp; What comma, where?&nbsp; Who  cares? (I feel the same way about Trivial Pursuit and once got fired from a game over the mere inquisition&nbsp; who gives a shit?)<br /><br />I have always been a writer.&nbsp; I would not be surprised to hear my mother say I scribbled a novel in crayons in my infancy in some archaic toddler language. When I am NOT writing, is when someone (read: intervention) needs to step in and point me to my computer or a pad of paper, lovingly, of course.<br /><br />Written word flow is&nbsp; a natural state for me - like breathing.&nbsp; How fortunate am I for this very truth?&nbsp; Beyond the sky grateful.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I've been a rebel about it though - I don't necessarily put my words into a lovely leather bound (yet, still, always vacant) journal.&nbsp; I have a habit for taking notes on things I hear and see - and thus the closest thing I can find to write on will suffice.&nbsp; Bar napkins.&nbsp; I am certain that if I published all I've written on bar napkins all my life, I would likely have that Great American Novel written complete with footnotes, an introduction and whatever else comes from behind curtain 3.<br /><br />However, there is a glitch in this theory. &nbsp; The trouble with bar napkins as a mode of transportation for words&nbsp; is that it is not their natural state to absorb words. (seriously - how would you feel if you were partly made from a dead tree - hanging on to other people's world history is not likley the first thing on your mind) BN's are all about the beverages - and spillage or sweating.&nbsp; What feels like&nbsp; ruination of my solution to world peace is, in actuality the fact that&nbsp; bar napkins&nbsp; and me are not meant for each other - thought for a million years it felt like were my deepest relationship.&nbsp; BN's know their role in divine order and know all there is to know about boundaries.&nbsp; <br /><br />I often ponder, and perhaps&nbsp; I'm not alone - do you think that Hemingway drank so much so that he might revisit what had come to him yet had forgotten? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, likely it's a good plan he didn't have sticky notes at his dissposal.&nbsp; Imagine what we'd have missed out on........<br /><br />One of my reasons for this freedom from normal composition rules is clear to me.&nbsp; Through a friend of a friend I had I was offered a writing job&nbsp; years ago when I was managing an animal care facility..&nbsp; For pay. First thought was WHAT?&nbsp; you are going to pay me to write about my calling?&nbsp; Once I moved past that initial shock,&nbsp; I entered the ZONE OF TERROR.<br /><br />I don't love punctuation like some don't care for cilantro. Punctuation feels like opposing the mafia after having had dinner and wine with them . it appears like there is no way out, especially if you don't care for meat sauce AND cilantro. In actuality this is really just another lesson in how hard we are on ourselves.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point, I was asked to write one of the lead articles for a magazine.&nbsp; The mere thoughts of commas, apostrophes, semi-colons had basically delivered me into some sort of post traumatic stress disorder reaction, with no cure in sight..&nbsp;&nbsp; I was solidly convinced I could not write because I have bad grammar.&nbsp; I surpassed the deadline.&nbsp; I drug my feet until I knew it was too late for me to succeed.<br /><br /><br />Which went well up until THE EDITOR called and asked point blank - what is the hold up? I was in the middle of my usual work day and her honest question stunned me into answering her with truth.&nbsp; Her response is one I will never forget - "Seriously?&nbsp; That is why you haven't written this amazing story?&nbsp; Don't you know it is my job to edit your words and make your tale more polished?".<br /><br />Um.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Had no clue.<br /><br />I sat down and wrote the article in a matter of minutes based on the freedom THE EDITOR gave me. <br /><br />So, sorry for typos and missing comma - I'm in a constant construction zone - please pardon my mess. (and PS - comma comas must be akin to zombies.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
