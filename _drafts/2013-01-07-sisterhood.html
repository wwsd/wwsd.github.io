One of my sisters from my blood family left the United States again today to return to her home in Aisia.&nbsp; She can't access a lot of social networking sites there, and it's been such a joy to see her take on things for nearly a month - her photos, her words - her joy and even her sadness.&nbsp; Not to mention a phone call on Christmas that left us both dying -nearly literally - from laughter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another sister of mine is this kind of amazing as well.&nbsp; She and I have spoken on the phone nearly every single day for gosh - over three years now.&nbsp; We have coffee togehter, we dream, we cry, we mourn, we share and we learn.&nbsp;
