"There is a cycle of love and death that shapes the lives of those  who chose to travel in the company of animals. It is a cycle unlike any  other.<br />To those who have never lived through its turnings or  walked its rocky path, our willingness to give our hearts with full  knowledge that they will be broken seems incomprehensible.<br />Only we  know how small a price we pay for what we receive; our grief, no matter  how powerful it may be, is an insufficient measure of the joy we have  been given." (Suzanne Clothier from Bones Woul Rain From the Sky)<br /><br />
