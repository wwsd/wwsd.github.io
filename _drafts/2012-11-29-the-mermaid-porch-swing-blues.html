It's true.&nbsp; Even mermaids with porch swings get the blues.&nbsp; Thank my lucky stars (sun, moons and planets, too) that usually music, a good book and memories can cure whatever might be feeling like an ailment. &nbsp; <br /><br />I recently had the incredible experience to meet a dear friend of mine from New Orleans in Chicago.&nbsp; He had a speaker he wanted to see and it was closer to where I was living at the time and I flew in to meet him.&nbsp; We had a fabulous adventure - from Dunkin Donuts to wandering, to allowing time for rest that we both dearly needed.&nbsp; I wrote - he'd lunch with a pal, and so on.&nbsp; It's one of those major gifts from the universe to find someone who is such a lovely travel companion.&nbsp; It was a divine gift during a period that felt like had not end in sight - I am nearly swallowed by gratitude just thinking of that trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Music is a vital part of my life.&nbsp; One afternoon, I meandered back to the hotel from seeing a play, filled with joy and at each corner on the Lake Michigan there was someone playing an instrument into the street going away from the lake - it echoed lovlieness to me.&nbsp; Someone to Watch Over Me, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I couldn't tell you what else other than it spoke to my spirit.&nbsp; That was lots of happiness brewing in the people walking home or whereever.&nbsp; The music was very soundtrackish and rounded out that particular stroll for me.<br /><br />Our last night there, we saw the speaker (that's a WHOLE other post of lovely) had dinner with a friend we'd connected with then realzied we'd not yet had a full taste of the Chicago Blues.&nbsp; After summoning some energy from a couple of gin and tonics, we made our way to the subway to head to a club my TC had been to before.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were heading out of town, so actually had to go down under to get the right line - and upon our descent (with an acapella serinade greeting us) I saw a daisy in full bloom growing from a tiny crevice in the subway wall.&nbsp; Suddenly the adventures of the day and the adventures of the night were disceted and I found a new energy - I was ready.<br /><br />Well, or so I thought.&nbsp; We got to the club - in which I might add, I felt the history in a delightfully eerrie manner - sort of like when I had to sit down on the steps of the WEstminster abby as an 18 year old visiting England - I could feel the history in such a beatiful, deep way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Daisy growing out of the crack in the subway wall.
