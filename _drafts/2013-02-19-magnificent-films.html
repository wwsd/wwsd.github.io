Some movies just capture life and leave me having mine feel changed while simply experiencing them.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've got a few crochet prayer shawls I'm finishing up and I love to watch movies or something that filles my spirit when I create.&nbsp; I recently asked my pals new and long-time for some recommendations.&nbsp; Wow - they did not disappoint.<br /><br />"Intouchable" - a French film that exhuded so much life I had to take breaks a) because I was laughing, crying or laughing AND crying so hard or b) becasue I simply never wanted it to end.&nbsp; This movie captures the amount of extraordinary joy that can be found in the joy we see our beloveds - those we love experience....magnificent.&nbsp; It's subtitled - but you'll forget that about 3 seconds in.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
