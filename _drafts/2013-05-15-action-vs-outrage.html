Having been involved in the animal care profession for nearly 14 years has undoubtedly left a mark on how I perceive "helping".&nbsp; For years, I went after saving animlas lives with a vigor unlike I had felt for anything else in my life.&nbsp; It was a space I could do what felt measureable lend a had in to the universe.<br /><br />Lately I have been kicking around the concept of retiring from that line of work and my reasons are more interesting each time i explore them - 1) I am removing drama from all aspects of my life in general - and there is SO much drama over finding homes for animals.&nbsp; We don't have a standardized anything - from feeding protocol to vaccinations to appropriate housing to staff jodb descritiptions.&nbsp; There are a variety of philosophies availsble&nbsp; - while that is lovely for the public to go with an oranization they agree philisophically with - it often means some groups simply cannot sit at the same table with groups they disagree with.&nbsp; It often means we are spending precious resourses (ncluding energy) on fighting each other. <br /><br />Some of us are an angry, jaded bunch - who can blame us?&nbsp; We see thousands of homelss animals dumped over our shelter fenches, tied to rescuers front porches<br />&nbsp;staff - emotional issues<br />But the bottom line is&nbsp; if we work in the animal care profession in any capsitity - volunteer,scooping poo, shelter management, crossposting online - our job is compassion.&nbsp; We are SCREAMING at the public to do more, spay neuter everything on earth, adopt volunteer donate - we are blaming any body of people we can from the public that "doesn[t care to the organizations that don't share our philosophies (for many reasons, I might add). <br /><br />Where is the compassion in that?<br />no matter our role or organizational philosophy - we are in the&nbsp; business of compassion no matter if we are the scooper of poo or the fundraiser or the person that ethanizes<br /><br />A short time back, a group that I have worked with on and off for years now had apparently posted a photo of a n animal in dire need and asked that we (the friends of this group on Facebook) share the post.&nbsp; I didn't see it.&nbsp; What I did see was a message shastising people for not crossposting and then the almight threat of unfriending those that didn't take the time to care enough to share. <br /><br />Shame isn't the name of the game anymore. <br />We are in the business of compassion <br /><br />With a vast number of people shifting into more concious living, I think we are about to discover that we don't care to have pictures of dead cats lined up in&nbsp; a row - that is not going to force me into running to the nearest shetler to adopt a cat or 27 cats.&nbsp; That is going to make me unfriend that organization.&nbsp; We aren't giving the public enough credit - by contstantly tossing out euthanizasia statistics (which - by the way ther is also no standard on - so we don't REALLY know how many animals are dying each day - nor do we know how many are getting adopted)<br />and posting horror photos.&nbsp; We are fear mongering with these techniques. <br /><br />As the professionals it is our job to TEACH to educate - to help people understand the differences in types of organizations and how they operate, the best way to find the best pet possible for their home/family &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />definition work - no kill<br /><br />The story as I know it - of the Asilomar Accords - is that a group of leaders from all walks of the animal welfare profession got together in Asilomar tasked with doing what I call "definition work" - they had to make very clear what the terms we commonly use in the animal care world were/are and my impression is they weren't allowed to ocme out of the room until they were done.&nbsp; (I'm sure that wasn't the full truth - but hsi is my story)<br /><br />So men and women who had worked for hundreds of years when you combine their total helping animals sat down with the intent to explain what we do in animal shelters - public and private and, rescue organizations. <br /><br />Understand this&nbsp; - I have never once come across a person in my dealing swith hundreds of animal care organizations that has not been without passion for their 'work'.&nbsp; In fact for many it is more of a way of life, than a job.&nbsp; With passion, comes well - not always love. <br /><br />I keep pictureing these people in this massive conference room - sitting around drinking ice water - loking at a glass wall that overlooks oceans and mountains about to enter into a conversation that no one had been able to have yet, due to differing philosophies.&nbsp; I wonder what the agenda looked liek - I mean truly - where do you start?! <br /><br />I liken it to the concept of the supreme court - changing law, setting precendent.<br /><br />but I pay attention to those things, because I look for commonalities before I seek differenes.&nbsp; The problem I saw was that it might be a challenge to trickle this work - these "ways of thinking" to the people that are in it - to the people that scoop poop and are paid minimus wage and that soemtimes are trained to euthanize animals.&nbsp; Will this informtion reach them.&nbsp; My second question was - will this information reach the public in an effective manner?&nbsp; by then we were alreadya throuwing around fireld related lingo like "no-kill" ad other rather confusing phrses/words and were beginning to lose public support if there was outrage over how one group operated over another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
