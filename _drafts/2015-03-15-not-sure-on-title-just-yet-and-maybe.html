&nbsp;I request that you read this before you read any of my words further, please:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/style/remembering-lisa-adams.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;bicmp=AD&amp;bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&amp;bicmst=1409232722000&amp;bicmet=1419773522000&amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/style/remembering-lisa-adams.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;bicmp=AD&amp;bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&amp;bicmst=1409232722000&amp;bicmet=1419773522000&amp;_r=0</a><br /><br />&nbsp;There are several different takes on this in my mind. <br /><br /><br />As an animal care disaster relief specialist, thousands of animals are alive because of connections I made on the internet. <br /><br />That's a bold, yet true, statement for me to make - as it was never about who or when or where, it was about the life of the animal and trust.<br /><br />I didn't meet all of the people I sent animals to; &nbsp;I didn't have the resources to tour &nbsp;every home or ranch - but I relied on the fact that I could find references, photos and in many cases, honesty about the truth of the situation without having to travel myself from sea to shining sea. &nbsp;I involved my instincts when things felt "not so perfect" and I made a life-long list of connections that will always be there for the animals AND me, because of that. &nbsp;Thank you, internet.<br /><br /><u>Changing a life starts with wanting life to change. &nbsp;</u><br /><br />That's not my first experience with people I had "only" met on the internet. In 2001, I was in an online support group for a life experience I'd had that I was attempting to overcome. &nbsp;I found a group of people that had been through similar situations. &nbsp;I connected with a group of "sisters". &nbsp;We have all conquered and overcome that situation, for the most part, thanks to US. &nbsp;And yes, we've met in person so many times - there is no chance that we were not supposed to. <br /><br /><u>Support is support is support.&nbsp;</u><br /><br />Nearly a year ago, I moved to live with my mother, thinking I was the one that needed help, when we discovered (uncovered?) as a family that she has mixed dementia and that her living alone was no longer an option. &nbsp;I have researched and discussed all of this with so many people on the internet that I am able to present options to her physicians about what I'm seeing happen that can help them make sense of it all. &nbsp;I've connected with some who are either in or were in similar situations and I am more prepared than ever to take care of her because of these contacts. &nbsp;I am more confident and compassionate in my care-giving, which in turn allows my mother to feel just the same towards me and others around that love her as much as I.<br /><br /><u>Big love is not the easiest thing to find.</u><br /><br />A few years back, I read a book that literally set my life on a different path. &nbsp;I wrote the author and she and I became friends; meanwhile I connected with many others that also felt the same sort of greatness that her words allowed. &nbsp;I bow in grace to these friends - they are not false - some have sent me oils, other funds when I was at the end of my rope, others prayers and always love. &nbsp;I know not what I would do without this inspirational crew of big love and I only hope I return half as much in gratitude and love. <br /><br /><u>Reunions</u><br /><u><br /></u>When I first discovered Facebook, I was excited, yet wary. &nbsp;That is, until the love of my life and I re-connected after 20 years. I've since found family I didn't even realize I had; connected with dear, long-time friends and found people I didn't even know I'd missed. <br /><br />_____________________________________________<br /><br />What I know is it's not always the people you have coffee with each day that help you (or the animals) through the toughest of times. &nbsp;The above article is inspirational in that point. &nbsp;It shows the magnitude of connection - of being one with others.<br /><br />In gratitude, Lisa. <br /><br />Splash.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
