I've not a clue who first came up with the theory about the ripple Effect - but I do know this - It's as real - as tangible as air and ice cream.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've watched some movies, TV shows and read some books here lately that discuss, in so many words, the fact that we have an obligation to be kind.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's first discuss my theory on obligation - I've never seen it as a bad word.&nbsp; But I've also not quite figured out what it fully means. It's easily confused with the word "purpose".&nbsp; I'm not sure we are meant to know.&nbsp; It comes from a place so deep within us, we rarely take a moment to actually think about it.&nbsp; I believe that some of us are born with more natural ethics and morals than others.&nbsp; I believe it's a nature and nurture situation.<br /><br />I had a conversation with a friend this very morning that put a completely different light of understanding on romantic love.&nbsp; In this talk, we said out lout that being so attached to somone often means you can't see each other.&nbsp; We discussed the fact that if we took time to heal ourselves, to be, and to trust Goddess, that we might just actually be prepared enough to have an amazing love.&nbsp; That if we took our ego crap out of the equation - we might find ourselves in the midst of the most incredible threesome ever - me - you and God.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've had the amazing fortune of finding humans in this life that I almost cannot bear to be without - I was at a meeting one night in New Orleans.&nbsp; The topic was "The Secret".&nbsp; I think we may have even watched the movie.&nbsp; What I remember is this - there was a man, sitting at my feet, that I was floored by my very own attrativeness to - I was shocked.&nbsp; I wanted nothing more than everyone else to go away and leave us alone.&nbsp; That did not happen.&nbsp; So instead, I put my brave on and found him via email and basically, I invited myself into his life.&nbsp; We had several increidble encounters - and much of it was based on the fact that we had no expectations.&nbsp; We simply wanted to be around each other when we could and call that good enough.&nbsp; Fast forward several years and I found myself on a plane to Chicago to meet him - he had a talk he was attending and it felt like a fabulous plan that we might hang out together.<br /><br />He was right.&nbsp; I know that i felt like I was having some sort of confessional - I couldn't WAIT to tell him all I'd learned since I'd seen him last.&nbsp; And it felt to me that he couldn't wait to hear about it all.&nbsp; We laughed, rested, walked, ate and drank our way through the days we had together.&nbsp; AGain.&nbsp; There was the obviousness of no expectations - we were able to totaly enjoy just being.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's not always easy to be in a strange place with someone. Someont that you know - but well, you don't REALLY know.&nbsp; Travel brings out oddness and reality AND truth.&nbsp; It's like an even ground - where you both don't really know - but if you can take that as an opportunity for adventure, well, the sky is the limit.<br /><br />I'd been with a woman since I'd seen him last.&nbsp; She and I were to be married - but that's an entirely different conversation.&nbsp; He meditated each morning for I think at least an hour - it was his time for him.&nbsp; I'm horrid at meditaing - but I"m good at respecting other's space.&nbsp; One afternoon, I'd been out for lunch, and we weret o meet back at our room - and he was literally meditaing in the closet<br /><br />I"m not sure I"ve ever laughed so hard in my entire life.&nbsp; I was all of shocked, scared, surprised, amused, comfortable and writing some sort of ironic humor sotry in my mind all in the same second.&nbsp;<br /><br />I read books, watch movies and do lifein a manner that suggests I love to have every single emotion out to play.&nbsp; I want full, deep and out of nowhere experiences that make me feel everything I can possibly ever feel all at the same time.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's true.&nbsp; I want it all.
