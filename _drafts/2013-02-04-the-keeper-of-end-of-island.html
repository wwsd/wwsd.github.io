The year I first moved to Florida having had enough Northern Michigan winters to last me a lifetime, we celebrated Christmas on the beach.&nbsp; Shrimp and cocktails.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, we had unloaded all of our necessities - chairs, beach towels, the cooler, books, blankets, journals and goodness knows what else, and got situated near the water's edge.&nbsp; Soon it became apparent we had inhabited prime real estate and people would walk by us - inches from where we were in varisou states of recline.&nbsp; I felt a lot like I was living a live version of space invaders.<br /><br />So, I got up and built a fortress around us - a two or three inch wall in a large oval - leaving room for a dance floor and an opening in front of us should we wish to invite anyone in.&nbsp;<br /><br />It worked.&nbsp; People started to respect our boundaries instantly - and walk aroud either in front of us or behind us, but ever respectful of our little haven.<br /><br />A few hours in, a man we had seen walk towards the end of the island earlier, returne.&nbsp; Wihtout speaking a word or a moments hesitation, he stopped in front of the doorway and knocked on our invisible door.&nbsp; I remember all three of us looking at each other thinking - this was high on the scale of delightful.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was likely in his 50's, well, tanned and explained that he and his family were there on holiday to celebrate Christmas on the ocean.&nbsp; He made it is personal mission to walk to the end of the island twice a day.&nbsp; We dubbed him the keeper of the end of the island - and all that was missing was a sword for the full knighting ceremony.&nbsp; I recall thinking it didn't surprise me as much as I thought it might, that he understood all that we did about our beach castle, with very little actual spoken conversation.&nbsp;<br /><br />It turned out he had a son our age and he strode off to get him and bring him to our scared space, with our permission.&nbsp;
