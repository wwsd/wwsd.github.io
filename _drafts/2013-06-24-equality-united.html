In the last 24 hours I have been led to watch three different documentaries:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;-&nbsp; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., A Historical Perspective<br />&nbsp;-&nbsp; Not for Ourselves Alone - the Story of Elizabeth Cody Stanton and Susan B. Anthony<br /><br /><br />As aware of these three individuals and their compassionate arimies as I am - to watch them right now while our Supreme Court is preparing to hand down rullings related to same sex law.,<br /><br />Watching them both within a 24 hours period has been almost eerie - combined with where we are currently - it appears to be so many of the same phrases, the same energy - the same battle.&nbsp; In a way, it is.<br /><br />In a legal manner it is not<br /><br />As a woman who prefers relationship swith other women, it might be that you'd think I'd be all - oh, hey, comone lov ei slove.&nbsp; But it is o much more complicated that that.&nbsp;<br /><br />I belive we have thise decisions in front of us at varying times of extreme huamn spirital growth spurtsgrotwh .&nbsp; - when we are ready. <br /><br />You may ask - well, which side ar eyou on?&nbsp; I am a lesbian - but above all that, I am a human, living in a country that promised me I was allowe dto pursue happiness.&nbsp; that in fact, it was my right. <br /><br />So, however thingsg turn out, I'm happy that I&nbsp; can seet a little bit more of the sameness and the differences and if you ask me, I think The United States of Ameria is ready on a psiritual level to quit inviting themselves into our bedroom.s &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;After I watch this again - for the 100th time today, I will be likely entwined with Ghandi tonight as well.&nbsp; For in each of these steps forward we are beyond fortunate in having our forefathers and sisters stand up for equality. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pCDEiaoEP2U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pCDEiaoEP2U</a>
