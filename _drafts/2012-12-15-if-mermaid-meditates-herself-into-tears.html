If a mermaid meditates herself into tears of gratitude, does the sea grow deeper?<br /><br />A friend is visiting from Ohio and I think it was all of three seconds after she arrived in Alabama that she suggested we go to the beach.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; Being a self declaired mermaid, it made perfectly logical sense, that the beach is where we should go.&nbsp; So, we made the trek south to Panma City - then headed west to Destin, Navarre, Pensacola, etc.&nbsp; My travel companion is perfect - in fact I would not be surprised in the least to learn that she has fins somewhere in her spirit as well.&nbsp; We meandered our way back east, driving as close to teh water and through villages I - tiny pockets of universese i never even knew existed before.&nbsp;<br /><br />We found ourselves fiarly close to back where we started, wehn we realized we'd not had quite enough beach just yet.<br /><br />I realized in the midst of the meal I'ds never have enough beach.<br /><br />I rested in our beachside room with the kindo f anicipation a child has on Christmas eve - excited, energized rest fille dwith anticipation and delight of things to come.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I woekeo to Cat whisteping from the other roomn - Pssst!&nbsp; Jennifer - the sun is coming up and it's sparkly outside.&nbsp; And I we sat on the balcony in our silent awe and watched the sun move closer tous, slowly and gently and the pelicans danced in their lines of perfectly, eer humorous order.&nbsp; I walked the beach just now to find sehells and doscivered some more new things about myself.&nbsp; Such as I can meditate into myself into tears and taht all shells - yes, even the 'broken' ones are perfect.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is so much to be grateful for.<br /><br />And yes, I know, from the man in the t-shirt shop from a day ago - there is deep sadness.&nbsp; He told uut this is happening all time time - this is just another cry for help - until we all learne to be kinder I'm afraid we will continue to see exahmples of extrememe fear and agony such as this.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be kind.&nbsp; Be grateful.&nbsp; Love.s to be careful when we swtached the news knowing it would affect us.&nbsp; And there was no way to hide from it when I opened to send some emails las tnight.&nbsp; I'm sad too - adn respectful.&nbsp; B <br /><br />
