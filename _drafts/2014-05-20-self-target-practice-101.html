The perfect recipe: <br /><br /><br />If you are able to lay your hands on some martyr, add at least two fistfulls<br />Fresh out of forgiveness and/or never tried that?&nbsp; Hunt some down anyway - it will make this taste and feel even better.<br />Add a generous, consistent portion of compassion.<br /><br />A pinch of garlic - fresh is best - but isnt' that alwasy true?
