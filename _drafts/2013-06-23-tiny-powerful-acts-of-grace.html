My mother - a beautiful, wise soul taught mys siters and I about grace and compassion in a tiny way that often returns to me.&nbsp; If we spilled our drink - milk,&nbsp; or water - even red cool aide - she would thank us.&nbsp; She would say that that part of the carpet or the table or the wall needed cleaning.<br /><br />She took that whole no crying over spilled mil thing and turned it into a lesson of grace. &nbsp;
