I have this new, old world now.<br /><br />In the past year of my life my mother has been diagnoised with mixed dimensia. My dear family has bonded in unimaginabale ways and I have found something closer to myself than ever because of all of it. &nbsp; My father passed away. &nbsp;I had two magical visits with my newphew who lives in China and one with my sister who also manages to live on the other side of the universe, precisily.<br /><br />I've learned to spot a vine as a potential danger on the side of a chimney, how to be certain the trees are being trimmed right, and you don't even want to hear about the plumbing issues I've learned to deal with....Did I mention I've somehow managed to have a ''thirsty roof"? <br /><br />I whine much more than ever, and with pretty good cause. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
