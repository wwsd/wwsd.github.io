I attempt to write about what it's like taking care of my mother with &nbsp;serious memory loss. &nbsp;A couple of diseases, some stroke activity in the past and several other things contribute to these circumstances. &nbsp;Grief, notwithstanding. &nbsp;Add in a couple of surgeries on a collarbone and welcome to my mom's world. <br /><br />I've tried to write out my day in, day out situation - but it never comes out right. &nbsp;It sounds like whining 99 percent of the time and that is the last thing I'd like to be projected upon this circumstance. <br /><br />So here's some scoop:<br /><br />&nbsp;- It's hard enough watching your mother's memory diminish, but then having to be the kind, patient human that tends to reminding makes it a bit more challenging as the daughter.<br />&nbsp;- It's not a half day, sit on the couch and eat bon bon's the other half of the day kind of a gig here - it's 24/7. &nbsp;I don't rest well often, unless, seriously gratefully, my aunt is here for the night, as I'm always concerned about a fall or some other kind of health issue - I'm almost always half awake. &nbsp;I also am a night owl and especially now I comprehend - it's related to the fact that it's the only time I have to sit and write and think and watch what I want and NOT answer questions for others - I can turn into me again. &nbsp;Then I hear mom pop up in the morning, and up we go and onward.....no calling in sick, no naps without interruptions - it is what it is.<br />&nbsp;- I manage to shower about two to three times a week, as it's not comfortable to leave the room and wonder what might be happening 13 stairs down with my feet all slippery<br />&nbsp;- There is nothing more profound than having your mother thank you for your presence. &nbsp;Period.<br />&nbsp;- There are days that I think I might lose my mind. &nbsp;These are the days I forget to ask for help - &nbsp;from people, from the animals and even God. &nbsp;Sometimes I actually come to my senses and remember that all love is possible and answers aren't mine until they are given. <br />&nbsp;- Without a support network - including family, friends, music, animals, books, therapists there is no possible way to do this type of deep care. <br />&nbsp;- When someone tells me "well, I can do dinner on Tuesday at 7" and I cannot it's frustrating to not only you maybe, but even more to me. <br />- I'm so grateful I've studied some of God's work in giving it up to the Divine. &nbsp;I'm so grateful our housekeeper (a) for her and (b) that she changes our family bible to a different page each time she comes to clean. &nbsp;While she may not speak English, nor I Spanish, we find a place of communication that awes me each week.<br />&nbsp;- I'm NOT as exhausted as I think I am. &nbsp;I'm not as exhausted as I think I am. &nbsp;Did I mention? &nbsp;I'm not as exhausted as I think I am.<br />&nbsp;- Or maybe I am. &nbsp;Did I mention I'm caffeine free (mostly) for the reasons of lack of sleep I mentioned above?<br />&nbsp;- I do NOT feel trapped, that is so amazing to me even as an introvert. &nbsp;I love being a homebody. &nbsp;We have a delightful woman that comes in a couple of times a week to take care of mom while I run about town, and my aunt is nearly always available. <br />- Planning sucks. &nbsp;I currently have 5 doctors appointments I'm trying to schedule in for mom - might actually be more than that soon.....and no matter who is here or what is happening, that is priority one. &nbsp;And it's paperwork and and and and<br />- Please never use the phrase<br />"'be sure to take time for yourself" unless you plan on being here to hang with my mom while I'm buying bon bon's. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;That is not an option. &nbsp;Or you could just send bon-bon's. &nbsp;(just a thought, though I don't like chocolate as much as my mom)<br />&nbsp;- there are MOM DOWN days. &nbsp;This means nothing else is priority. &nbsp;Other than feeding and watering the animals. &nbsp;Gotta stop the earth for a bit, answer multiple questions<br />&nbsp;over and over again, gotta be sure SHE KNOWS she's certain she has a will and so on.....<br />&nbsp;- Grieving is a state of mind I've learned a) to exist within (whether it be pre or current related) and b) not have a true chance to do<br /><br /><br /><br />It's incredibly challenging to be a caregiver in the first place. &nbsp;Many of you are right here with me in my heart and it may be that I'm writing an outline for a book about this kind of thing.....thanks for the read. &nbsp;And for those fellow caregiving peeps out there - wow - Amen - big love and gratitude.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />This Mermaid<br /><br /><br />P.S. &nbsp;I love you more than ever, Mom o' mine. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
