<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I recently experienced an extraordinarily vulnerable patch in this thing called my life, and I have to tell you, I could not be more grateful for it.&nbsp; I'd been carting around this rather make believe mother lode of burden over some things it it felt like I'd never&nbsp; - I mean never ever be able to do anything about them.&nbsp; I had made up some some seriously awful stories in my head and realized I had put myself in the Loserville zip code for all my life. I'm here to tell ya was pretty dark in this little head of mine....</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Blessedly I have several very strong, very compassionate, very brave friends and family who love me more than I could have imagined&nbsp; - and in a way, they gathered to do a spiritual intervention.&nbsp; I'll be honest, it was super scary, but then it got easier and easier and easier - and are you kidding me?&nbsp; There is a parting gift when you are so wide open that ya show your innards?&nbsp; You get even closer to your people? Thank you Gods and Goddess's in all forms.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">One of the really interesting things that happened was that I realized I now had all this space in my spirit since the burdens were out out in the open now. It's like I did a serious spring, summer winter and fall cleaning of my soul.&nbsp; There was time now to think ahead instead of just getting by.&nbsp; Suddenly it dawned on me - I've never really had a dream.&nbsp; I was so busy wallowing in&nbsp; fear that I never really took the time to ask myself what I might like to do with my life. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I began to get so in touch with myself on a cellular level to really find what made my spirit soar with joy. I started to do things like make crochet prayer shawls that I could sell and writing for my blog and as I watched myself really putting my creativity out there - I was rather stunned - inch by inch bravery began to strike and I was liking the taste of that....I'd really comprehended that the Divine had my back and I was ready to start this life on a more ethereal level. Talk about rebirth - wowza.&nbsp; It's lovely to wake up the middle of your own life, by the way - thinking let's get this party started instead of autopilot Eeyore mode.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm well on my way to building a brand - and it's all mine - I'm filling my life up with things that I love.&nbsp; Period.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A few days ago, I invited some friends to my Facebook page and just moments later, I got an email from a friend of mine I know from my work in the animal care profession - he's currently in the Bahamas and in fact traveling all over the world now, to speak about canine&nbsp; behavior.&nbsp; In this email, he had attached a picture.&nbsp; Of what you might ask?&nbsp; The red-headed mermaid that was watching over him while he worked today. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I am a FIRM&nbsp; believer in signs - and thankfully I'm pretty often aware enough to notice them and feel some rockin' universal validation, but I can't&nbsp; say that I've ever had such a clear sign sent through another, to me .</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I just have to shake my head in total wonder and grace and enjoy how much the Divine loves me. Not to mention the support that is surrounding me like a pod of dolphins from all of you; please know I am so grateful. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Did you hear that?&nbsp; I think it was the splash of a mermaid.....</span><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TDW5aV3d20c/UbSNZynXuuI/AAAAAAAAIDQ/6WQxL5PzOCk/s1600/IMG_0496.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TDW5aV3d20c/UbSNZynXuuI/AAAAAAAAIDQ/6WQxL5PzOCk/s1600/IMG_0496.JPG" height="239" width="320" /></a></div>
