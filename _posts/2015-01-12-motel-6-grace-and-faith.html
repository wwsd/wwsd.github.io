<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">In my mind, any new year comes with renewed hope.  Know I'm a believer in any moment being filled with hope, but new years seem to come with extra.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Today I got proof of that in the form of grace and faith.  </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">After phone calls to various people at a certain insurance company about various claims including a potentially killer plumbing bill, I was a wee bit dismayed.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">I took mom to her usual doc's appointment, had her sign a check so I could pay the co-pay when I learned we didn't owe one!  BONUS number one.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Headed to do some shopping while she finished up her appointment, returned home to a few more business calls, when a call came through from Motel 6.   </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">What?   </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">I finish up my insurance call just in time to answer, and it's a man – Rusty.  He's found a check, of my mother's signed, but blank, in the biggest, most corporate store in town.  </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">I think.  And then I cry.  I realized I'd not put the check meant for the un-owed co-pay where I normally would as in, a wallet or in my pocket, but in my TO DO LIST novel, and it had fallen out, in the middle of said corporate store and this man picked it up, took the time to look up our phone number and called so I could come pick it up at his temporary home in a hotel in our town.  </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">There is a level of amazing that goes with this type of kindness.   </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">When I pulled up to the hotel where he and his wife are living, as they do work here in our town.....this large man came out of the room first.  I was grateful I'd taken my friend with me – ya know, just in case, and then – out comes Rusty.  Check in hand, holding it out.   </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">I'd love to tell you more about that moment – but all I remember is Rusty holding his hand out to shake mine as I hugged him and cried.  And repeating “You have no idea, you have no idea how grateful I am”. His friend clapping and saying “Oh, this is a great moment to witness”.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">I turned around as I walked back to the car, blinded by tears of gratefulness, and I saw his wife peek out the hotel room door.  Waving happily.   </div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">A few more stops on the way home of errands and I still could not stop being overwhelmed by grace. As I pulled into the driveway of home, “What if God Was One of Us” came on the radio.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">So, I cried some more.  And called Rusty at his hotel room to really explain how important his action was.  It was a good idea to call him again. We both admitted things most strangers do not to most.</div><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><br /><div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Rusty – thank you.  For every moment of each of the lessons learned today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
