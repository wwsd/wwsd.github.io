(sorry - I'm just lazy enough to not put in all the required punctuation and my editor is on personal leave, speaking of said aunt that smells good and sends super thoughtful gifts)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Suddenly - what to my wondering eyes should appear but an image&nbsp; of "Mother Mary" - going by many other millions of names in this particular rendering - but I saw MOTHER MARY clear as day. (see above photograph, because not even my most clever self could make THIS stuff up)&nbsp; And then the Beatles joined the party in my mind.&nbsp; I was instantly transported to one late night talk, when Dan and I attempted to define "Folk Music" and him saying something to the tune of&nbsp; "it's whatever we want or need it to be.&nbsp; It's when we try to define things that we end up in trouble - or missing something really amazing."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Ahem. Sign delivered.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/ajCYQL8ouqw/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/ajCYQL8ouqw&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/ajCYQL8ouqw&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I took the job - and hopefully I'll fill those shoes well.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That day and today The Beatles; "Let it Be" is a folk song of pretty serious magnitude to me. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm ever grateful to all the parties involved in bringing me a moment as simply divine as that one.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">PS - Don't worry, cuz/bro Dan Bearden - we'll keep the music playing.&nbsp; Mother Mary said so.</span>
