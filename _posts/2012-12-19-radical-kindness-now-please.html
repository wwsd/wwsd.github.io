As I looked at this, I thought again, this is how I try  to live my life every single day.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This year, I made a deal to not put pressure on myself during the  Holiday season as part of my trek towards being kinder to myself at all  times.&nbsp; Many amazing reasons exist - like I moved recently; I'm  learning more balance in general, including finding a productive  writing/creating structure, financial, emotional and otherwise; the bulk of my peeps do not live in even the same state as I, and so on. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Yet, while sipping my coffee this morning, I looked around the room at all the things I felt would be good to get done/mailed/finished/made/created/wrapped/blessed/baked/etc.&nbsp; before Christmas and I found myself wanting a nap at 7:38 AM.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So, here is what I've decided:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While I shall absolutely enjoy the warm, love-filled feeling of all Christmas Holiday type activities/etc., to the fullest extent, I am declaring it Christmas-giving all year long.&nbsp; I forgive myself in advance and totally allow myself to go with with feels right and wonderful whenever that might be.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm not insinuating my alter ego Elf Rowan needs to die, or that I am refusing to celebrate this beautiful season at all, or that some surprises aren't under the tree or in stockings already.&nbsp; I love the scents, the foods, the sights - the glow - the ritual of it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">What I <i>am </i>suggesting, insisting even, is that I love and cherish my family, my friends,myself and Spirit every day, period.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Instead of rushing about trying to cram all that love into a few dinners where people aren't present with their ever monstrous running to do list in their minds - or trying to snap together some serious "quality time" to share holiday cheer - nope.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; I'm going to stretch the warmth of the season out to the entire year.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm going to go stark raving mad and send more real mail - a note here, a crochet trinket there, those kinds of, sweet, silly surprises. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When I think of someone - I'm going to get radical and stop for just a second and use Facebook or email to the power of good and send a note, or a quote or a silly picture, and I'm going to tell them I'm thinking of them and that I love them.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm ever grateful for the grace-filled gift of kindness and I'm excited about my new Christmas-giving everyday plan. &nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Blessings, love and light to you and yours.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span>
