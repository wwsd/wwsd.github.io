Not long ago, a friend and I spent some time at a family cottage and well, it turns out I'm a drummer. &nbsp;(or not &nbsp;- please hold)<br /><br />My drum kit includes a certain size cottage cheese container and a variety of pots and pans. <br /><br />Earplugs for my family. <br /><br />And gifted drumsticks - they were picked from a tree near the cottage, and carved with my initials by one of my dearest pals. &nbsp;I was thrilled. &nbsp;Until each one, in it's own time, broke and flew across the room that particular weekend. &nbsp;For the record, no one was wounded. <br /><br />I began to remember that singing made me feel release and freedom each time I put my MP-3 player on and banged out the next tune. Next thing I knew I was banging out my frustrations, singing my tunes at the tops of both of my lungs. &nbsp;Many involved left the room.<br /><br />Today though, wow. &nbsp;Today, said friend showed up again, and with not only grown up drumsticks, but drumsticks in a wildly perfect shade of purple.<br /><br />I cried. &nbsp;I'm hopeful he didn't notice that part. &nbsp;Or that he did. &nbsp;Either way, I'm grateful in ways I can't find just yet. <br /><br />I'm hopeful you have drums to beat upon that make your heart remember to beat when things feel so tight and tough that there is no other way to express. <br /><br />I bet my stix will remember. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9K62zCPKnBo/VQ0OO04WDII/AAAAAAAAJC8/0Gb--ZvHdtw/s1600/perfect%2Bpurple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9K62zCPKnBo/VQ0OO04WDII/AAAAAAAAJC8/0Gb--ZvHdtw/s1600/perfect%2Bpurple.jpg" height="320" width="179" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
