Dear God -<br /><br />You've shown me that I have enough shoulder strength here lately. <br /><br />I think you need a time out. <br /><br />Possibly because I pray to you each second of every day here lately, and also, because you have shown me I've enough to handle.<br /><br />The day after my mother's Birthday, really? &nbsp;We have to put her cat to peace? &nbsp;And she cannot remember where the cat is. &nbsp;I run through this in my head &amp; my heart and I can only find the words she would say to me in hers - she was hurting honey, she didn't need anymore of this life. &nbsp;She had a lovely world. &nbsp; She had to go to feel better. &nbsp;She is our guardian angel now and she shines over us like a shooting star. <br /><br />For the next several days I will need to repeat the above paragraph in different tones, and with large love &amp; patience, as my mother has Alzheimer's with a twist of Parkinson's<br /><br />I love my mother more than I can explain. &nbsp;And each moment we have together is a blessing. &nbsp;But we could use some peace right now, Mr. God. &nbsp;A lot of it.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Mary Lee's daughter<br /><br /><br /><br />
