It took me about three weeks to work up the gumption to decide what to do about a Christmas tree this year. &nbsp;My mom has a HUGE pretend one, that took ninja-like wrestling to get out of the house last year, finally, in March. &nbsp;Oh yes, March. &nbsp;Things like Christmas trees don't seem to be top of the priority list when one's mother has a diagnosis of Mixed Dementia. &nbsp;Better known as (Doctor dependent) as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases. <br /><br />But I digress.....Well, sort of.<br /><br />The most important thing to me in the universe currently is seeing the FULL ON glowing smile my mom gives when the joy is seeping out of her. &nbsp;She's functional with a side of repetitive short term memory issues, so it's not like she's lying in a bed hoping for a miracle. &nbsp;She IS a living miracle. &nbsp;And trees are one of her most favorite things. <br /><br />Last year I had the sad task of having a trimming service come out and deal with the trees that were either deceased or dying and our Texas yard is barren for us girls from Michigan used to a tree at every turn. I was gently reminded at the second funeral I attended this past summer for two fathers of dear friends, that trees are vital to life. One of the sons recently pointed out to me that one could purchase a living tree - one that could be planted and grow for the future. <br /><br />So I donned my Santa hat, and went to the local nursery after phoning to be certain they had what I was looking for. &nbsp;The very lovely people that came to our home and had to take away our deceased trees. &nbsp;The wife of the owner came out and helped me select the perfect tree, along with her dachshund who wasn't as fond as I, of my Santa hat. &nbsp;My main concern above WHICH tree, was how was I going to fit it in/on the vehicle in the midst of a lovely West Texas dust storm when lo - she told me they deliver. &nbsp;It took a lot out of me to not sit on the ground and sob. <br /><br />Picking out a tree for one's family, by oneself is a challenging task &nbsp;I'm used to the frivolity of the experience of many laughing and listening to Christmas songs and laughter over that one time the tree fell on Aunt C's head when she and I attempted to put it up ourselves to surprise the family. &nbsp;(Thankfully, no emergency rooms or professionals were required that year...but close) <br /><br />So this year, I asked the lovely owner if she would take a picture of me, so I could share the moment with my family who could not be with me. &nbsp;And with a line of at least 7 people there, she excused herself and came out to take my photo in front of our soon to be Christmas tree. &nbsp;Yesterday, they delivered it. <br /><br />Naturally it was too tall. &nbsp;Perfectly too tall. &nbsp;And the delightful man that we use to take care of our lawn, moved it to the corner the tree will spend some time with us, helped trim it and even placed the angel on top. Naturally, as well, I cried. <br /><br />My suggested lesson in all of this is to call in a favor from angels and see just where it gets you. &nbsp;It might be in the tiniest of places or the deepest spaces of your hearts. <br /><br />Merry Christmas.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oFoi2uCJhKE/VnXRnEt_5LI/AAAAAAAAKnU/5tkC8jQVkS0/s1600/IMG_20151219_145750316.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oFoi2uCJhKE/VnXRnEt_5LI/AAAAAAAAKnU/5tkC8jQVkS0/s320/IMG_20151219_145750316.jpg" width="180" /></a><br /><br /><br />
