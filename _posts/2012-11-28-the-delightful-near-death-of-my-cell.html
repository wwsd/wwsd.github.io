<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">My cell phone's screen has made a decision to remain frozen in eternity.&nbsp; It's been that way for a few days, but I thought I'd kind of wait out Mercury Retrograde and see if it didn't spark back to life. Nope.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Looking back over the past few years, I have needed to replace my phone for one reason or another, just about exactly every 6 months.&nbsp; Mind you, it's not one of those fancy-schmancy gizmos, it's a little LG with a keypad, small enough to fit in my pocket, so it's not modern technology making this happen.&nbsp; Unless there are some implanted gremlins I'm unaware of.&nbsp; It's also not that every time I've dropped it in the drink - or<i> a</i> drink or <i>the</i> toilet, to be most specific, that was only once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">$3,654, 777.32&nbsp; later spent purchasing the newest model of the unsmart phone from V-------, it dawned on me, I might just ask my V------- pals to help a girl out and send me one of their retired phones lying around in their old phone cemetery drawers.&nbsp; So, I posted this morning on Facebook and lo and behold, 10 minutes later, the gently used, ever loved phone will be in the mail, hurling through space to little ole' me.&nbsp; In fact, there are two on the way and may I just say being prepared feels awfully wise at this stage?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While that might be happy ending enough for some, I, of course, have a couple of side stories to tell that make this an extra delightful situation.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It got several of us to talking about our magnetic personalities.&nbsp; Many of us can't keep a watch alive to save our own lives.&nbsp; Some blow out street lights, others computers and various other electronic devices.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion, that it's a good thing a) because it gives us a break and b) because our energetic vibrations have been raised to a really, super cool level.&nbsp; I was also able to admit publicly that I would be a 12 step program nightmare if I had to try to keep a houseplant alive for a year.&nbsp; So, I'm feeling all strong about that.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Then, someone pointed out how rapidly I manifested a solution.&nbsp; I, personally, believe that the word 'manifest' is simply a swanky word for 'ask'.&nbsp; Then, I got all misty-eyed, realizing I'd turned a corner on something I've struggled with my entire life.&nbsp;<i> <b>I asked for help for ME</b>.&nbsp; </i>Not for the animals, or for a pal, or a friend's second cousin once removed - but for me.&nbsp; And I was immediately validated by a beautiful, amusing, witty, extremely generous and love-filled conversation.&nbsp; AND two phones.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">All I had to do was ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Thanks y'all.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><br />
