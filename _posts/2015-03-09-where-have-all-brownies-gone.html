So I'm reminded today more than usual, that my mother has well, Alzheimer's. &nbsp;Because I'm looking for the brownies I baked instead of a cake for my aunt's birthaversary.<br /><br />My mom loves sweets more than God. &nbsp;So usually, I can figure out where she hides them. &nbsp;I know she has a chocolate chip stash - I understand that. &nbsp;I have one too for PMS purposes only, of course.<br /><br />But here's the real gig - wherever the brownies may rest in peace, I'm thinking of my friends and my family that also care for their mothers and fathers.<br /><br />We all have our moments and the joy that comes with giving care to someone that brought us into this life is endless. &nbsp;I sent my mom to bed thanking her for all the laughter we shared today. &nbsp;(including brownie loss)<br /><br />The responsibilities are endless when caring for a person who can't remember what day it is. &nbsp;The joy is bigger than that. <br /><br />Where have all the brownies gone? <br /><br /><br />
