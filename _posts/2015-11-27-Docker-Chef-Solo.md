Need to test a chef recipe or role?  I have a docker image for that:

[Docker Chef Solo](http://joshuacox.github.io/docker-chef-solo/)

The instructions on that page should get you up and running pretty quickly.

As always feel free to open an issue or comment here if it is not working for you, or you want to understand more about what is going on.
