My agenda tomorrow includes something called a "book signing" at a funeral home for a friend who recently passed. &nbsp;Knowing him as well as I barely do - here's my to do list: <br /><br />1) get up<br />2) feed/medicate animals<br />3) feed/medicate mother<br />4) get clean including goal of good hair day - wonder if I have something clean/appropriate to wear<br />5) feed self<br />6) go to grocery store to get cat food and mom's med refills<br />7) pick up aunt<br />8) visit neighbors who have a collection of Nativity scenes they have not put away yet, so we can see them<br />9) go to wine store<br />10) go to funeral home to sign the book and show we care<br />11) go to closest pub and toast said deceased knowing he would love my priorities<br /><br /><br />There is a bit more to the day than I am able to emote into words just yet, not the least of which would be how everyone does everything differently when it comes to death. &nbsp;I LOVE that there are no rules - at least that I'm aware of. &nbsp;Keeping in mind that most of the death related ceremonies I've attended have been held for animals or very, very (did I mention VERY) unconventional people. &nbsp;Or relatives that passed on or before I was 12 years old. <br /><br />I love living in a small, big town that seems to understand that there are those of us (ahem, me) that don't understand. &nbsp;It's kinda crazy in a 6 Feet Under way.<br /><br />I miss you L - and I hope you can see and feel that love wherever you are. &nbsp;Thanks for fixing my iPad. May your new space offer you more cracked screens, lots of appreciated challenges, better goo-gone, even bigger learning and ever more laughter. &nbsp;Keep the faith dude. &nbsp;I feel you. &nbsp;Thanks for signing the book of our friendship.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Jenn
