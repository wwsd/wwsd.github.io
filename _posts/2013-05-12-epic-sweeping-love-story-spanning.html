<div>Often it feels to me as though the best way to thank people in my universe is to show by example some of the magical things I have learned. This is for my mom, Mary Lee and my sister, Kate - both extraordinary examples of motherhood. I sit in gratitude that somehow I ended up related to these two incredible women - I will choose them over and over again in all of my next lives....</div><div><br /></div>This is an email exchange between Kate and I from many moons ago that I treasure endlessly.<br /><br /><div><u><b>From Kate: </b></u></div><div>Ok--so it's 2am.&nbsp; I found out yesterday that I have 2 stay at the  Hong Kong Hospital tonight for surgury on my other (right) hand Thursday  a.m.&nbsp; My son is laying wrapped in blankets on the corner of my bed  (naked, i find after rousing him to return to bed--)&nbsp; The cat is  sprawled on her back in a crevice between the kid and i--stretched to  maximum cat length.&nbsp; I, myself, am laying with twisted legs to avoid  squashing kid/cat, and twisted arms among the half a dozen "prop  pillows" to keep the casts from scarring my forhead like the night  before.(Did you know if you rub a plaster cast on your forhead all night  it leaves a rather large strawberry resembling rug burn?)&nbsp; My husband,  who has the nack of sleeping through hurricanes--is enjoying the  honeymoon bed to my left,&nbsp;just East of chaos, and snooring readily. </div><div></div><div>I wake up cold and hurting and not really wanting to attempt the  aerobic yoga it will require to reach medicine for comfort...or to pull  up the blankets for that matter (with my teeth).&nbsp; I wait it out as long  as i can.&nbsp; I finally, thinking it MUST be morning, make my move.&nbsp; Now,  keep in mind, it is Never this cold in the tropics but the current temp  is 40--COLD for here--and I do not have ANY shirts that fit over casts  (and are warm).&nbsp; Nor do I have any warm pants I can pull up and down on  my own.&nbsp; BUT, Afin, my saintly house helper, is finally starting to  catch up (poor woman) on vacation laundry. When I approach the closet  the first thing I see is this GREAT fleecy robe that my sister so  generously donated to me at my wedding--(after much wanton gazing from  afar on my part).&nbsp; You see, I've long been seeking out the perfect  robe.&nbsp; My friend Sheryl makes them, but I have yet to commission one and  when I laid eyes  on jenn's--it was the closest  I've seen thus far in my seeking.</div><div></div><div>So i quickly go through the possibility that the robe may fit over  my arms and that maybe I can even get it on by myself--without&nbsp; waking  the husband from his snooring nocturnal bliss.</div><div></div><div>And low...</div><div>it does work.&nbsp; And it is warm.&nbsp; And comfy.&nbsp; And I can even tie it  by myself (which is more than i can say for my coat around my waist--ask  the vulnerable woman at the bookstore in Hong Kong,"Could u do me a  favor...?" I said.).&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>So, keep in mind during all of this--I hadn't had a chance to sit  quietly fireside in my lovely ski condo in my newly acquired robe on my  honeymoon--due to the unfortunate snowboarding incident.&nbsp; This, was my  first magical experience with the robe--and i discover it even has  pockets.&nbsp; Rather Bulky pockets I am thinking---but it was just washed so  they must be inside out--so im trying to adjust--with my cold, hurting,  broken arms flailing. Oh.&nbsp; It's a newly dried/washed piece of paper.&nbsp;  Probably a receipt--NO?&nbsp; Maybe, just maybe, a love note from my sister!&nbsp;  We do that sort of thing, our mom taught us how good it feels.&nbsp; When  Michael moved to China the year before I did--I put notes  everywhere--some of which he was still finding after I moved in...&nbsp; BUT  you never want to get too excited expecting a love note and it turns out  to be a grocery list.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>But low, </div><div>it <i>was</i> a love note.&nbsp; But, not ONLY from my "real"  sister--also from my "sistas", the Goodlife Inn Keepers.&nbsp; And--I sit--in  the bathroom of my home in China and think&nbsp;of all the women in history  who experienced going off on their honeymoon, scared and nervous and a  bit issolated--without so much as a love note from mom.&nbsp; But here I am,  pre-SECOND-surgury, a little scared and nervous and a bit issolated, and  I am reminded from the warmth of my robe of how beautiful my life is  and how fortunate I am to know my friends and how great mt family is...  And how perfect it is that I found the note now, in a moment of literal  cold darkness--and even after chinese water torture via washing  machine..</div><div></div><div>Perfectly in tact--</div><div>without so much as a smudge--</div><div>a love note to me and my new family.</div><div></div><div>You might drop a random love note somewhere today--in hopes it makes your loved one feel as special and warm as my robe.</div><div></div><div></div><div>love u,</div><div>k</div><div></div><div></div><div><u><b>From THE ROBE &amp; me:</b></u>&nbsp; </div><div><br /><div>Dear Kate:</div><div>As THE ROBE, I wish to congratulate you upon your recent discovery  of the comfort and utility I am to provide you.&nbsp; Even though I exist  merely as a rather suitcase size of fleece imprinted with suns, moons  and stars I must admit that&nbsp;(apologies for egotism) I knew I was made  for you. I was quite apprehensive to come out of the suitcase my first  evening at the GOODLIFE INN.&nbsp; I had overheard the crowd and realized  that I would be in great demand even as your sister flaunted me through  the great room and flopped down in front of the fire place.&nbsp; (I'm FLEECE  for the love of God and all that is flammable!)</div><div></div><div>It was then that I lengthened&nbsp;my pockets so that you would receive  love notes.&nbsp; I widened my sash so that you&nbsp;could tie and untie me as  needed.&nbsp; I knew that I would comfort you like no other.</div><div></div><div>Do I miss your sisters slovenly ways?&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; I dare to shout that  the last foster puppy she brought in to the house narrowly missed me  during yet another annoying attempt at disproving any and all theories  of house breaking.&nbsp; Often I would lie discarded&nbsp;on the bedroom floor as a  mere bed for Mama Zen, the ungrateful shedding beast of a cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Now, I am a robe with meaning and purpose.&nbsp; A ROBE with a mission  to keep you, my mistress, in comfort, warmth and poetry filled pockets.</div><div></div><div>Coveringly yours - </div><div>ROBE</div><div>Reader:&nbsp; Though my previous wearer did not truly abuse me, I always  wondered if she truly needed me; especially as she resides in&nbsp;the  TROPICAL CLIMATE of Florida.&nbsp; It is not my intent to slander her by any  means.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>___________________________________________________________________________________</div><div>Never underestimate the power of a love note, especially written in permanent ink.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tdFpDTRQbsE/UY-WrQiR73I/AAAAAAAAHzA/T3-Q7gR7KFk/s1600/S3700007.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tdFpDTRQbsE/UY-WrQiR73I/AAAAAAAAHzA/T3-Q7gR7KFk/s1600/S3700007.JPG" height="320" width="240" /></a></div><div></div></div>
