<br />I am a mighty <u>joy huntress</u>.<br /><br />What <i>is</i> a <u>joy huntress,</u> you ask?<br /><br />To "Hunt joy" is a phrase I created a few months back, just prior to a potentially toxic situation my friend and I were headed into. I knew, beyond a shadow of doubt, this "potential toxicity" was based on my old beliefs. Once I shifted gears into the gratitude zone, all would be well, as usual and thankfully,&nbsp; I have learned that within even the tiniest of normal circumstances, there is joy to be found.&nbsp; I'm on the case like a bloodhound named Sherlock Holmes. <br /><br />Exhibit A:<br /><br />I had lived in Ohio for some time and began to frequent the store just around the corner.&nbsp; It was convenient and the people that worked there always left me feeling like I had been not only been cared for, but about.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><span class="null">I went to the store at Halloween time and discovered one  of the</span><span class="null"><span class="null"> rather demure, ever-cheerful, elderly woman</span> clerks dressed as a green M&amp; M. We talked and laughed to the  point of tears. Her bravado and customer skills impressed me so much  that I was moved to write a note of praise to the store's corporate  headquarters.</span><br /><br /><span class="null">For the record, it took me all of three minutes to write said letter of praise including extensive time spent with spell check. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I returned to the store a few days later and there was the woman again - she was wearing her normal uniform and clothing (not that I'd ever see her the same again, I might add),&nbsp; except for she had pinned a note underneath her name tag simply stating "Thank you to the lady that sent the email."<br /><br />I acted as if it wasn't me&nbsp; and asked her for the story. To hear her recant the joy over the situation was incredibly precious to me. &nbsp;&nbsp; She was glowing.&nbsp; I was near to tears, I was so excited that it had brought her that much loveliness. &nbsp; I did manage express that it was obvious to me why someone would take the time to 'turn her in', with as well as she took care of us, her customers.<br /><br />I felt like she needed to know we had become her flock. <br /><br />I often wonder how many times on those days that she wore that message under her name tag, that she shared the story.&nbsp; I still attempt to imagine how delightful that must have felt - to anyone that may have asked and most importantly, to her.<br /><br />There is something quietly magical in the opportunity we all share as members of the human race to&nbsp; joy hunt.&nbsp; It's restorative in ways we forget unless we live it.<br /><br />Did you hear that?&nbsp; That joy was the sound of the Splash of a Mermaid. <br /><br />
