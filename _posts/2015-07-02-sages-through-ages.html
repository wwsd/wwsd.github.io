<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There really aren't words for this type of conversation, but here is my attempt, not to mention you may not know the person I'm discussing herein - but here's the deal - say I love you to everyone you can, every chance you get. &nbsp;Always.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many moons ago, my sister was married and as part of her ceremony, a Shaman, by the human name of Dr. Bruce Cox did a blessing. &nbsp;It was one of those remarkable life moments. &nbsp;Spirit, love, ancestry - everything was everywhere, twirling around us all in the smoke of the sage that day. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Years later, when my dear stepfather passed away, he did another blessing. &nbsp;I wasn't witness to that one, but I could feel it from 1600 miles away. &nbsp;Deeply. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I arrived in Texas, over a year ago, I was beyond thrilled to think I might get to spend some time with this spirit and learn from him. &nbsp;Turns out, he had moved to another state, but I still had the good fortune to hang with him poolside and listen and learn and laugh, many times. &nbsp;The first night I saw him again, he did yet another blessing. &nbsp;Looking back, it was as though he could see I needed protection, support, healing and superpowers before I even knew I needed them all. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When we learned about my mom's illnesses, one night I ran away from home. &nbsp;To the Coxs' Big Spring home - about 3 blocks from mom's house. &nbsp;I raged, and I ranted and I cried as Bruce held my hand. &nbsp;In these moments, I could not help but feel more strength pouring into my soul. &nbsp;He gave beautiful wisdom, kindly and with grand humor and I began to realize I actually could do this.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bruce and his amazing wife (see, there aren't enough words?!) Sheryl, also raised one of my now dearest friends, Josh, whom I now have the opportunity to do some life-changing work with. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And just last week, I had the change to speak to Bruce on the phone about a project and was able to tell him I loved him, yet again. &nbsp;Thank God. &nbsp;Because, yesterday, he transitioned, after a good cup of coffee.Last night I dreamed of him all night and even woke myself laughing at one point. &nbsp;Which is the only way he'd want it. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the Master Gardner's sale this year, I bought a little tiny sage plant, with great hopes of growing it the size of the state of Texas and hoping Bruce would bless it, so I could use it for blessings. &nbsp;When mom and I returned home from a trip, I discovered the sage had indeed grown - though merely the size of Big Spring, but the incredible part of the story to all of my family, is that there was a feather, firmly settled into the planter just next to the sage (enter goosebumps here) and I suggested that Bruce and Spirit had already blessed it. &nbsp;I could not be more grateful. &nbsp;Say I love you every chance you get. &nbsp;Always. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tkr1SZzCDv8/VZVG2ZNva5I/AAAAAAAAKB8/zzOd2ZEMNF0/s1600/IMG_20150628_160657701_HDR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tkr1SZzCDv8/VZVG2ZNva5I/AAAAAAAAKB8/zzOd2ZEMNF0/s320/IMG_20150628_160657701_HDR.jpg" width="179" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />
