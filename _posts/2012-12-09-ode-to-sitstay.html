<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I try, at least once a week to have an entire day that is only about me - anything goes. In fact, the only rules are whatever it is, I must gain pleasure and that I must not catch a glimpse of guilt. &nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">One of my angel sisters taught me that downtime (AKA sit/stay for all you dog training speak people out there) is a vital way of  keeping balance in my world, and that rest is likely one of the most healing zones  in the universe for the core spirit.&nbsp; It is self care - not  selfISH. This has been one of the most lovely and productive lessons of my entire life.&nbsp; Feel free to insert ironic giggle here - downtime equals productivity?&nbsp; YES.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sometimes&nbsp; I eat soup (and yes, crackers) in bed watching movies for the entire day in my PJ's.&nbsp; Other times it's crocheting my heart out - or writing - or cooking - or reading - or doing 12 crossword puzzles - or going for a hike - or learning something about a topic that has been burning me with curiosity - or I build a mental a fort of blankets to block the energy of others.&nbsp; For quite a while, it meant two, that's right gentle reader, TWO naps in one day. I proudly call that my sloth period.&nbsp; I went wild one Sunday and took three baths.&nbsp; I may stay away from all communication technology - or not. My choice.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">One of the magical parts of this concept, is that often, I will do one of the things on my to-do list that has been giving me pressure.&nbsp; Or (as my friend M calls it) J(z)enn day - pressure suddenly turns into pleasure.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This morning when I woke, I realized I needed to have a day to myself,&nbsp; STAT.&nbsp; It's not holiday stress - that's not my style, as I dearly love this season that is all about love - it feels as though everyone has joined me on my daily take on life.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So, what's up, Jenn? - that's what I had to ask myself.&nbsp; (It's always a good idea to actually get in touch with yourself, I've noticed here lately)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">What I realized is that during this transition time from my recent move, is I've been putting subconscious pressure on myself.&nbsp; The garden needs my attention. I owe countless responses to emails.&nbsp; I offered to help a friend with her resume and didn't realize she had a deadline.&nbsp; I washed my sheets yesterday but they never quite made it on the bed.&nbsp; (Well, they are on the bed, but in a pile at the foot of it - unfolded I might add- I just pretended I was at a slumber party last night)&nbsp; I've got a list of gifts to make for people.&nbsp; I've had some incredibly deep, life-changing conversations recently that I've not fully processed.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Ring, ring.&nbsp; It's for you, Jenn - it's the universe phoning to tell you to slow down.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Doing, doing, doing is not necessarily being.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sometimes I feel as though I need to justify J(z)enn days.&nbsp; Then I stop and ask - to who?&nbsp; Why? The more I treasure and take care of myself, the better off everything is.&nbsp; I even posted on FB that I was officially declaring this day as all mine. The responses were&nbsp; beautifully stunning - everyone told me to enjoy myself - that I was worth it. I assumed it may appear that I was isolating or even (GASP) being lazy.&nbsp; The real question in those assumptions is whose life is this?&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sometimes the answer is simply this:&nbsp; <i><b><u>It IS all about me.</u></b></i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It is my greatest wish that we all begin to realize self care, especially when under pressure is the only choice - the only answer.&nbsp; Sit/stay.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Must dash - The Sloth Era discussion reminded me I need a nap and my soup is ready.&nbsp; </span>
